Also excluded from the list of governorship candidates is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Valentine Ozigbo. On the list, Hon.

For the All Progressives Congress, (APC), Senator Andy Ubah’s name was published to run in the poll.  My Attack Politically Motivated – Soludo(Opens in a new browser tab)
