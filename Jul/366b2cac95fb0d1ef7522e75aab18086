An All Progressives Congress (APC) Concerned Youth Forum has kicked against the postponement of the party’s congresses and national convention indefinitely. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had shifted the timeline for the conduct of its congresses and national convention through a letter the party sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). And in the letter, the ruling party did not fix any date for the postponed exercises. Thus, speaking at a press conference in Maiduguri on Sunday, the Secretary of the APC Youth Forum in Borno State, Umar Yakubu Bwala , said the sit-tight syndrome is in favour of party excos clamouring for extension of their tenure. The forum called for conduction of congress in Borno and urged the State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum to prevail on the national body of the party to please allow party elections into wards, local governments and state as the constitution stipulates in Article 17 of the party’s constitution that anybody that holds office for two terms is not allowed to hold the same office for the third term.
