BY HENRY TYOHEMBA | Director-general of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, has assured Nigerians of adequate safety for Batch ‘A’ Stream II corps members as they set to resume activities at the various orientation camps in the country. Ibrahim gave the assurance yesterday during the 2021 Batch ‘A’ pre-orientation workshop held in Karu, Nasarawa State with the theme: “Managing Corps Population in the Orientation Camps in the Context of the New Normal.” He said, “We are going to be guided by the security agencies. We have been partnering with them to take corps members to where we have been advised to because the safety of corps members is very paramount to us.” The NYSC DG said the workshop was to review previous orientation courses with a view to improving its performances in subsequent exercises. He said, “It is worthy of mention that all the orientation camps have been put in conditions that will allow seamless conduct of the exercise in line with the approved COVID-19 prevention guidelines. “However, we would use the opportunity of this workshop to, among other things, harness our experiences and explore the prospect of increased camp capacity without losing sight of the need to adhere strictly to the safety protocols as we must learn to operate optimally under the new normal,” he said. The Nasarawa State governor, Abdullahi, commended the efforts of the NYSC DG, management team and stakeholders towards enhancing the viability and relevance of the scheme through evolving the transformational programmes and policies. The governor, who was represented by the commissioner for Youth and Sports Development, Othman Bala Adam, appreciated the contributions of corps members deployed to Nasarawa State in the area of agriculture and food sustainability through the development and cultivation of demonstration farms.
