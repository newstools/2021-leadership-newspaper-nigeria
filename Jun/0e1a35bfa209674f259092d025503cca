Sports promoter and executive chairman of the Delta State Sports Commission, Chief Tonobok Okowa, has declared his intention to become the next president of the athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN). He assured the athletes, officials and stakeholders of the AFN a new dawn if elected president of the federation in the June 14, 2021elections. Okowa in a statement issued by his Media Aide, Jovial Oluchy Agbagwu, promised a sustainable welfare package for the actors of the game against the background of complaints of poor welfare programmes by the federation. “My mission is to bring back the glory days of athletics, unite all stakeholders of the sport, bring in sponsors that will cater for the athletes and officials, and fans back to the stadium as seen in Europe and other parts of the world,” he said.
He also gave his word that the seemingly intractable issue of funding would be tackled headlong as his administration would be in partnership with the private sector to attract funds to the federation to reduce the burden on government. On the factionalisation of the body, the Delta Sports Commission boss said  concerted efforts will be made to unite the factions in a reconciliatory move that every stakeholder will appreciate. He also vowed to bring back the memorable days generally referred to as the golden era of athletics in the country when athletes, especially home based had the opportunities to compete at various meets saying he will restore it.
