The All Progressives Congress (APC) Oyo State has dragged the state Governor, Seyi Makinde and the leadership of the Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC) to court over plans to conduct local government polls. The party alleged that they were out to waste the state’s scarce resources and also make a mockery of democracy and the rule of law with their plans to go ahead with the conduct of the local government election slated for Saturday, May 22, without the APC and other registered political parties. The Caretaker Committee Chairman of the APC in Oyo state, Chief Akin Oke, stated this at a press briefing held on Wednesday, at the party’s new state secretariat, Oke-Ado, Ibadan. Oke said it became compulsory for him to once again address the press on the deliberate and unconstitutional acts of OYSIEC which has excluded the APC from the local government election. He “recalled that the court action of the members of ALGON in Oyo State challenging the unconstitutional dissolution of the duly elected executives of the 33 local governments and 35 local councils development areas in the state was finally laid to rest by the Supreme Court judgement of May 7, 2021. He said: ”One of the reliefs granted at the High Court among others was a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants in that case among which is OYSIEC or anybody whatsoever from conducting elections into the 33 LGs and 35 LCDAs and their councillors during the three years constitutionally guaranteed tenure of the chairmen.”
