Thirty years after the Ryder Cup delivered a “War on the Shore” at Kiawah Island, Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth could produce more US-versus-Europe fireworks at the 103rd PGA Championship. The year’s second major tournament begins on Thursday on the 7 876-yard, par-72 Ocean course at the South Carolina resort where the Americans edged Europe 14 1/2-13 1/2 in 1991. That gamesmanship-filled Ryder Cup was decided by a missed six-foot par putt by Germany’s Bernhard Langer on the 18th hole of the last match. Such drama was missing at the 2012 PGA Championship as McIlroy cruised to an eight-stroke victory at Kiawah Island, setting the stage for this year’s return to the Carolina coast. Four-time major winner McIlroy, a 32-year-old from Northern Ireland, and three-time major champion Spieth, a 27-year-old Texan, are both playing well and chasing history.

A victory at Kiawah Island would put Spieth in exclusive company alongside Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen.
