Expressing delight on the partnership with Polaris Bank, the newly elected captain of the Golf Section of Ikoyi Club, Chief M.I. Okoro, thanked the Bank and expressed optimism that the sponsorship would strengthen the already existing relationship between the Bank and the Ikoyi Club community. Acting Managing Director/CEO of Polaris Bank, Mr Innocent C. Ike, said the Bank is pleased to associate with the Ikoyi Club 1938, adding that sponsorship of the tournament underscores the Bank’s conviction on the role of sports, particularly golf, in enabling national unity, and socio-economic development. “We are excited to partner with the Golf section and, by extension, the Ikoyi Club 1938 in hosting this tournament. Our position stems from the fact that Ikoyi Club Golf Section is a foremost Golf Association in Nigeria, and hence provides us the platform for bonding, business and social good,” Ike said. “As a future-determining Bank and an enabler of enterprise, we are always willing to be part of any social and business partnership that holds opportunities for the larger society,” he added.
