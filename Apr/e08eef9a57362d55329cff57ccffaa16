By Dr. D.K Olukoya 2 God is faithful and great in provision:
He is the God of providence. His name is called Jehovah Jireh, which means, God our providence. He is faithful in providing for his people’s needs, food, water, clothing and shelter.  God is faithful and great in leadership:
Exodus 13:20-22 reads, “After leaving Sukkoth, they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. By day, the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night, in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people. This passage of scripture provides us with an accurate account of how God began a journey of leading the Israelites from Succoth, through a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. It can be seen that in spite of their shortcomings, God didn’t take the pillar of cloud away from them till their journey’s end. Indeed, the faithfulness of God has seen us through the years. He has led us through into rest from sins and sorrows, through mountains, rocks, hills and valleys.  God is faithful and great in redemption
Psalms 103:4 says, “Who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion.” Psalms 103:3 reads, “God forgives all your iniquities and heals all your diseases.
Psalms 107:15-16 reads, “Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind,for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.” The counsel is that we cannot exhaust His faithfulness, either by writing or by speaking. God is faithful. “Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men.” If you are to pay for the air that you breathe, can you afford its cost?
What shall I render to you, O Lord God.
