Bayelsa State government has seized 34 cows belonging to some herdsmen along the Palm Estate/Swali Road in Yenagoa, the state capital over alleged violation of its anti-grazing law. The state government through its Enforcement Committee headed by the commissioner for agriculture, David Alagoa who is assisted by the commissioner of police, Mike Okoli, rounded up the herds when they were grazing on the streets. Alagoa said the cows and their owners violated the state’s Anti-grazing, Rearing and Marketing Law which regulates the movement of cattle on the roads and streets of the state capital. He said the seizure of the cows was made after a four-week grace for the movement of cows from Bayelsa communities, local government areas to the state’s Palm Estate where they were mandated to be involved in ranching. “We gave them four weeks’ grace to move these cows to the Bayelsa Palm Estate. But we noticed that some of the herders moved the cows in the night around 1am from Bayelsa Palm Estate to Swali and trampled on farmlands on their way. We surprised them on Monday and apprehended about 34 cows. “We also met another herd of cows in a field feeding on corns and rice. Before we embarked on this anti-grazing law, the stakeholders including Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association of Nigeria were properly consulted and informed that there will be a stipulated fine if any seizure is made by the committee,” he said.
