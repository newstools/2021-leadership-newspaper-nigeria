 The  wife of Niger State governor, Dr Amina Abubakar Bello, has debunked allegations that she sold water through her RAISE foundation to residents of Minna. She said in a statement by her press secretary Rabi Sarkin Bello that the attention of the wife of the governor has been drawn to a publication in “The Nation” alleging her involvement  in the sale of water to  residents in Minna metropolis. “We would like to debunk the allegations as not only spurious but mischievous as the said project is one of the intervention programmes of the non- governmental, non- profit organisation founded by the wife of the governor, RAISE Foundation,” he statement read in part. She explained that the borehole in question was constructed by the Foundation as part of its Girl-child education intervention aimed at increased enrollment and retention of girls in school. According to her, the project called Water  for  Education Project has three main arms which included  provision of potable water for the school especially the girls, empowerment for youth and sustainability for the Foundation’s interventions. She said provision of water to girls in the school was a direct response to improve their attendance and retention in school seeing that it is mostly girls who do the chores in fetching water. Dr Amina said money generated from the project goes towards maintaining the borehole and water services, empowerment of the youth who drive tha tankers and interventions such as the VVF surgical repairs, MNCH program, Skill acquisition, treatment for cancer patients that the Foundation provides . “This is not a profit making business and all the money generated goes towards these three arms of the project” “Meanwhile, we must also emphatically state here, that the alleged N100 million purported to have been received from partners is also not only false but unfounded,” she declared.
