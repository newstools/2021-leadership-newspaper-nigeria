African Canadian social entrepreneur, Beausoleil Victor Emmanuel Mervyn, said writing books is another way for him to impact life aside from his advocacy and work for the inclusion and empowerment of African Canadian. Vicsoleil, as he is popularly known on Instagram, is an executive director of Social Economy Through Social Inclusion (SETSI). But he has also earned himself a reputation as a prolific writer with 11 books to his name. “Although, I have published 11 books, I have in all written 14,” he confirmed in a recent interview. Vicsoleil further avowed that working as an author has given him a great deal of leverage in life. “Becoming an author, I was able to passively generate resources for my family and leave the employee and self-employed category, which provided me the time to scale my businesses and invest greater time as a husband and father.” He continued: “My life as an author has changed my family’s trajectory and permitted us a lifestyle of travel and sovereignty.” According to him, he gets fulfilment from writing books that change people’s life. “Having people read one of my books and share how a chapter or an entire text has changed their perspective, circumstance or trajectory is an incredibly humbling yet powerful feeling for me,” he stated. While many writers have spoken about the drudgery of writing as a vocation and sometimes the challenge of marketing their books. Vicsoleil claimed it was contrary for him. He said: “I love to write and I always maintained a large network of dutiful brothers and sisters that were always willing to attend and become patrons on my book launches and events¨ He further asserted that maintaining a life of speaking engagement has also been advantageous to him. “If you move someone in a speech, lecture or workshop there is natural reciprocity that manifests if you have a book or product that aligns with your audience,” Vicsoleil said.
