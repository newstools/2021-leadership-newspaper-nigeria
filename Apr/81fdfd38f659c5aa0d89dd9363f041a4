Other featured acts on the album are Beyoncé, Rick Ross, H.E.R, and the duo of Lighthouse family. Jay-Z, in a statement released via Roc Nation, said: “I’ve always wanted to get in touch with my roots and connect to the motherland. You know, Africa is blessed with so much talent and I felt like it was time to tap into that resource. The Ascension is not just talking or focusing on Africa but it’s also about me giving back to the people, familiarizing with the culture and connecting more with the motherland.” It seems American artistes are finding Nigeria and Africa a worthy place to spread their music as the industry as continued to portray the country in good light even with the continued socio-political and economic problem.
