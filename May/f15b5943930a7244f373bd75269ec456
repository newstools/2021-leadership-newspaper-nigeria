The Spaniard was a set and a break down but outlasted the Canadian to win 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7-3) in a near three-and-a-half-hour contest. Nadal, chasing a 10th title in Rome, forced a third-set tie-break by saving match points at 6-5. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic reached his 15th Rome quarter-final in a row. The world number one and defending champion dropped his opening serve but recovered immediately to beat Spanish qualifier Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-2 6-1. Nadal, 34, will face German sixth seed Zverev or Japan’s Kei Nishikori for a place in the semi-finals. Djokovic will take on fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas for a place in the last four after the Greek beat Italy’s Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (7-3) 6-2.
