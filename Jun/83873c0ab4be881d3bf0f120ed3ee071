Hours after announcing resumption of flights to Nigeria, Emirates, the UAE official carrier, has again announced indefinite suspension of flights to Nigeria. The UAE authorities had initially fixed Wednesday, June 23, 2021, for resumption of flights to Nigeria. But in a statement on its website on Monday, the airline said, “In line with government directives, passenger flights to and from Nigeria (Lagos and Abuja) are suspended with effect from 21 June 2021 until further notice. “Customers travelling to and from Lagos and Abuja will not be accepted for travel. Customers who have been to or connected through Nigeria in the last 14 days are not permitted to board from any other point to the UAE. “We regret the inconvenience caused, and affected customers should contact their booking agent or Emirates call centre for re-booking. Emirates remains committed to Nigeria, and we look forward to resuming passenger services when conditions allow.” The airline had on Saturday announced resumption of flights, suspended in March over diplomatic row on COVID-19 protocols. The Dubai’s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management had lifted the ban on Nigeria and also removed the rapid antigen test and said passengers from Nigeria would only be required to possess negative PCR test. “We look forward to facilitating travel from these countries and supporting various travelers’ categories. “We will resume carrying passengers from South Africa, Nigeria and India in accordance with these protocols from 23rd June,” Emirates had announced.
