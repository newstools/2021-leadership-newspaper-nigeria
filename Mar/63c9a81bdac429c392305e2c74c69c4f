By PATRICK OCHOGA  | Drivers of petroleum tankers and other articulated heavy vehicles have blocked the Benin-Ore highway at Ofosu, over the killing of two drivers by suspected Fulani herdsmen Tuesday night. Ofosu is the boundary community between Edo and Ondo states. The hoodlums were said to have also made away with an undisclosed  amount of money stolen from their victims. The angry drivers who blocked the ever-busy highway at the military checkpoint, refused all pleas made to them by other motorists to vacate the road. Sources also have it that operatives at the military checkpoint have abandoned their posts, due to the chaotic atmosphere. It was gathered that the angry drivers are insisting that Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State must come to address them before they will open the road for use.
