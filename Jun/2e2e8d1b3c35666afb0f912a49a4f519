A diminished field of opponents at Wimbledon may make Serena Williams one of the favourites to win a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam, but her long-time coach believes the only important factor is her own performance. Injury concern for top-ranked Ash Barty and the absence of world No 2 Naomi Osaka and No 3 Simona Halep – who beat Williams in the last Wimbledon final – have given the American an ideal opportunity to match Margaret Court’s record haul. But coach Patrick Mouratoglou said it was not about the opponents. “When Serena is (playing like) Serena, I don’t know anyone that can stop her,” he told Reuters. “When I say being herself, first it’s being able to play at her level, and second, having the mindset that made Serena who she is,” he added. “I respect the opponents. I’m just saying Serena is Serena. There is not one woman in the history of professional tennis that has a record like her … When she thinks like Serena, when she processes like Serena, I don’t think anyone can stop her.” The All England Club’s lush green courts are a happy hunting ground for Williams, who has lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish seven times and also won the 2012 Olympics gold medal there.
