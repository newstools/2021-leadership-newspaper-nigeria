By Chibuzo Ukaibe, Abuja The National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee (NRSC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised the party leadership to exempt aspirants under 35 years from payment of nomination fees. Chairman and former senate president, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki stated this in a one-page letter addressed to the PDP national chairman Prince Uche Secondus dated March 25, 2021. The committee also advised the National Working Committee (NWC) to immediately recommend to the National Executive Committee (NEC) that the party constitution be amended to the effect that “only persons not less than 18 years old and not more than 35 years can contest for the position of Youth Leader at all levels of the party structure – wards,local government, state and national”. The committee explained that the recommendation was a result of the meeting it held with the party’s National Youth Leader and other youth leaders across the 36 states of the nation on March 9th, 2021 “in  furtherance of its mandate to resolve disputes, reconcile aggrieved  members and foster cohesion and unity within the party”. The youths, the committee noted, presented some requests during the  meeting and the demands were deliberated upon by the committee on March 22nd, 2021 following which the two-point recommendations contained in the letter were agreed upon. The implication of the recommendation on waiver of the nomination fees for youths aspiring to various offices means that where the party guidelines for instance demand that a gubernatorial aspirant pay N20 million for nomination form and N1m for Expression of Interest form, any aspirant below the age of 35 years, will get the nomination form at no cost while they only pay the N1m Expression of Interest fee. The measure is believed to be aimed at easing the burden of participation in the political process on the youths and encourage them to purposefully and positively utilise the new constitutional provisions on the age requirements for political office holders, otherwise called the Not Too Young to Run Bill.
