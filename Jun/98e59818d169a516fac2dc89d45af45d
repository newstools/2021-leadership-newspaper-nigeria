Senator representing Anambra South senatorial district in the National Assembly, Ifeanyi Ubah, has emerged candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) for the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State. Speaking to newsmen after he was declared the party’s candidate at YPP national leadership in Abuja yesterday, Ubah allayed the fears of Nigerians that the South-East crisis would disrupt the election coming up in November this year. Ubah said the current insecurity in the region would not affect the conduct of the polls and that his party would emerge victoriously. He said the party was not behind the crisis rocking the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA)in the state, contrary to insinuations in some quarters. “If other parties are having crisis it means their processes are not right. As you can see in YPP we are moving with the speed of light,” he said.
