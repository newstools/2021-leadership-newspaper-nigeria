By Jonathan Nda-Isaiah President Muhammadu Buhari has assured the international community of Nigeria’s preparedness to galvanize relevant stakeholders for climate action and readiness to support regional, continental and global multilateral processes for attainment of objectives of the Paris Agreement. Speaking at a virtual leaders’ summit on climate, the president in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the fight to redress the impact is the responsibility of all countries and stakeholders, congratulating President Joe Biden of the United States for renewed interest in the Paris Agreement. “I would like to express my profound appreciation to the President of the United States, His Excellency, Joe Biden, for convening this Summit at a time the world is experiencing tremendous vulnerability from the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change impacts, among several other global challenges. “The issue of climate change has taken the front burner globally, as its effects can be seen and felt all around us, ranging from increased atmospheric temperature to irregular rainfall patterns as well as sea level rise owing to the melting of glacial ice. “Nigeria commends the Biden administration for the positive decision of returning the United States to the Paris Agreement. In addition to bringing about abundant green economic opportunities to the US economy, the move further complements the larger transition process of global economies to low carbon development pathways,’’ he said. The president said the summit would prove instrumental in galvanizing high-level political support for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and its Katowice Rulebook as well as inviting more countries and stakeholders to take more climate-oriented responsibilities. President Buhari told world leaders that Nigeria was one of the most vulnerable nations, and it had started undertaking major environmentally sound and climate-friendly programmes, while treading the path of sustainability.
