A Port Harcourt-based comedian, David Atake Sikpa, has given a one-month ultimatum to publishers of an online newspaper, Point-blank News, to retract a story on the alleged N70billion contract awarded by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to the wife of the Minister of Transportation, Dame Judith Amaechi, or face legal action. Point-blank News had alleged that Mrs. Amaechi received the sum of N48billion out of the N70billion contract sum from the NDDC to train youths from the Niger Delta region on soap making. But speaking with journalists in Port Harcourt on Tu, Sikpa, who is also the managing director of Sedacco Group, said he had worked closely with the Empowerment Support Initiative (ESI), a non-govermental organisation set up by Amaechi’s wife for social and humanitarian projects. He said: “It is very sad that a woman who has devoted her time and resources to the cause of the less privileged through social and humanitarian services could be the target of ridicule and malicious attempt to tarnish her reputation to spite her husband. “Does Jackson Ude know what N48billion looks like? ESI is a
nongovermental organisation and it is run in accordance with international benchmark for NGO adminstration.” He described the publishers of Point-blank News a serial liars whose stock in trade was to blackmail unsuspecting victims. The comedian added: “Available reports show that Jackson Ude and his Point–blank publication have been consistent in publishing falsehood against perceived enemies but he has between now and June to retract his malicious publication and apologise publicly to Dame Judith Amaechi and Professor Nelson Brambraifa or we seek redress in court.”
