It would be recalled however that AMCON intervention in aviation and Arik in this instance was on the instance of the Federal Government of Nigeria that was concerned by the external monitoring of the activities of the airline between October 2016 and January 2017, which revealed a disturbing trend of overall deterioration in the affairs of Arik. facts are still fresh that the airline experienced frequent flight cancellations and poor on time performance (OTP), which is a critical service measurement of the ability to dispatch a flight within 15 minutes of schedule time. It noted that Arik’s obligations to local and foreign creditors and service providers were not being met, just as credit lines with foreign creditors were withdrawn with threats to even repossess Arik aircraft.
