Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, has said over N3.8bn is being used to repair four bridges damaged by vandals and petrol laden tankers. The minister disclosed this yesterday in Abuja at a Town Hall Meeting on Protection of Public Infrastructure.
The town hall meeting was organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture to address incessant and worsening destruction of critical infrastructure. Fashola, who was a panellist at the town hall meeting disclosed that N203 million was being used to repair Otedola bridge in Lagos, which was damaged by fire caused by petrol laden tanker. He said Kara bridge also damaged by fire from petrol-laden tankers, was being repaired with N605 million, while Tamburawa bridge in Kano which was damaged by illegal mining activities was also being repaired with N1.8 billion. The minister also disclosed that over N200 million contracts had been awarded for the repair of airport linked bridge in Lagos also destroyed by petrol laden tankers.  Besides the four bridges, the minister said N813.5 million was being used for the reconstruction of three bridges damaged by insurgents in Borno and Gombe states. Fashola said the damages were regrettable because they were consuming the limited resources that could have been used to tackle other nagging issues facing the nation.
