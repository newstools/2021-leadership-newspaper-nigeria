BY OLUSHOLA BELLO  | In what has been a truly unusual year, the Nigerian stock market last week closed positive with N778 billion in all of the three trading sessions in the last trading week of 2020.

The All-Share Index rose above the 40,000 psychological mark for the first time since May 23, 2018, closing at 40,270.72 points, with a weekly gain of 3.79 per cent. Consequently, investors gained N778 billion as market capitalisation advanced to N21.057 trillion. During the course of the week, the market saw investors take positions in industrial stocks such as Lafarge Africa, BUA Cement and Dangote Cement.
