It has to be run in such a way that it can rise to the current global challenges. It has to give the students the needed skills and knowledge to operate under a 21st century economy”. Oba Adu who thanked all Ikere people who contributed the fund said, “the university is our baby and we will continue to support it. I commend all my subjects, especially Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), the Chancellor of the institution for always standing by us at all times and for being the pillars of our success stories”.
