Moreover, the stock market has recorded a year-to-date loss of 4.6 per cent as at May 31, 2021 due to rising yields in the fixed income (FI) market. Yields on fixed income instruments which were depressed last year have been on an upward trajectory in 2021 amidst strong local demand for higher yields and the need to attract foreign interest in Nigerian securities amid a dollar shortage. Speaking on market performance for the first five months of the year, the founder of Tradelines DotBiz Investment Limited, Mr Tunde Jeariogbe, said equities performances on the trading floor were mixed, with January and April closing in the positive territory, while February, March and the just concluded month of May dragged performances through the bearish region. He noted that; “in all, the All-Share Index recorded a year-to-date loss of 4.55 per cent, while the market capitalisation of the listed equities shed N1.022 trillion. “Fundamental factors that dictated market trend through the five months observed so far in 2021 spanned from the second stage of COVID-19 that opened the market in January, the release of interim full year numbers that prepared investors for the final audited numbers, the first quarter numbers equally played its usual impact, as traders optimised the numbers to position against expected half-year earnings in June/July.”
