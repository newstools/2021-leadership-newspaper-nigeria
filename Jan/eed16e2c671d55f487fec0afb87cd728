He also disclosed that 12 persons arrested at the gardens “very late in the night’’, would be arraigned after the two weeks. “What we observe is that most of them (gardens) operate beyond the period (allowed). “The persons who were in the shops didn’t comply with physical distancing. Face mask wasn’t there at all and no hand washing points. “They were totally in breach of the COVID-19 protocol and the judge in his wisdom, Magistrate Egbe Arafe, issued the seal off order for two weeks. “After the two weeks, we will now come back to the court and continue the trial,’’ Attah said.
