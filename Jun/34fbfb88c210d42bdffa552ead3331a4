Following the defection of the Cross River State governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, from his former party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), a lot of encomiums have been poured on Ayade for taking a bold step to join the ruling party. Among the latest encomiums showered on governor Ben Ayade is the encomium which came from the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, who said that Cross River stands to reap the fruits of the Governor’s movement to the APC in the long run. Beaming with joy, while speaking on the sidelines of the award of the Governor of the Year on Agro-Industrialisation on Ayade by the Blueprint newspapers at the Congress Hall of the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, last week, Garba Shehu said: “I will just say we are excited about his coming to the APC.” The Presisential spokesman who said the governor has a lot to bring to the table, noted that, “Ayade is a man of huge intellectual capacity and I think in terms of governance, he is the best.” “The President has been to Cross River a couple of times. We went with the President and we saw the very innovative things he is doing with agriculture and all of that. So it is a big plus for APC and we are quite pleased that he has joined us.” Shehu maintained. On the Governor of the Year awarded to Ayade, Garba Shehu said Ayade merited it, hinting that “all the awards are merited. So I congratulate him. I will tell him that he is material for national politics beyond Cross River.”
