Arc Muftar Bello, Nigeria’s first golf architect and grand patron Parkland Golf Resort Club, has advocated inclusion of golf activities in the school curriculum in Nigeria to help build good character in the children. Bello who spoke during an interaction with LEADERSHIP Sports, noted that 99 percent of golfers are sincere and straightforward people, saying the entrenchment of golf in school system would help discover and nurture quality payers for the country and as well as win laurels for Nigeria in international championships. He disagreed with the notion that the game of golf is an exclusive reserve of the rich, stating that he was happy Parkland Golf Academy, a division of Parkland Golf Resort Club, has started promoting the development of junior golfers from the grassroots. “Yes, golf is for the elites but not for the rich. It is an elitist game because it is a place of enlightenment. It is an elitist and ethical game. 99 % of golfers are sincere people, very straightforward and don’t cheat. “If you have kids playing golf from age three to five years you would embed a very good character in them. The big challenge we have in Nigeria today is character. But in golf, you win some and let go others. If you don’t get the trophy today, you’ll get it tomorrow having learned from your mistake. “We have a programme for junior golfers, called Junior Tigers and the programme was created to enable school participation. We have debate club, cricket club, basketball club and so on in schools, why can’t we also have a golfing club. We should entrench golfing clubs in schools and include golf in the school curriculum,” Bello said. He explained that the desire of the Parkland Club is to ensure that Nigeria becomes a golf destination in the world
