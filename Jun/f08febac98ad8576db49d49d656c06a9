A group of Kano youths under the aegis of Saraki Is Coming In 2023, staged a rally in Kano in support of Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki even as it apologised for castigating the immediate past Senate President in the past. During the rally, which took place on Sunday, the group also called on Saraki to contest for the presidential office in 2023 general election. Led by the coordinator of the group, Alhaji Umar Faringida, the rally had a large number of youths chanting “Nigeria Sai Saraki 2023”, meaning, Nigeria for Saraki in 2023. “Following challenges being faced by Nigeria that include, among others, insecurity, unemployment and extreme poverty and worse of all a deteriorating economy, we have decided to come out and apologise to Abubakar Bukola Saraki and also call on him to come out and contest for the  Presidency in 2023. “We believe with his experience and knowledge, he has the capacity to resolve the current problems of disunity that is shaking the pillars of the country. “We all are witnesses to the current situation in the country where tribal and sectional sentiments are bringing down the very foundation of the country. “As a result, it has become pertinent for Nigerian youths to rise and choose a committed and dedicated leader that will save Nigeria from falling and we feel there is no one as qualified as Abubakar Bukola Saraki. “We saw the contribution given by Saraki as governor of Kwara State and as President of the Senate which since he left office, there has not been a serious and committed Assembly. “It has become incumbent on him to also rise up and answer the call of Nigerian youths to come out and save the country from what it is facing at the moment. “He should come and continue from where he stopped. This is the intention of this group called Saraki Is Coming 2023,” Faringida told journalists at the rally.
