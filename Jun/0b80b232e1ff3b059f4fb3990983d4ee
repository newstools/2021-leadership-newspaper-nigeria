Novak Djokovic survived a major scare from teenager Lorenzo Musetti on Monday to reach a 15th French Open quarterfinal and stay on course to become the first man in over 50 years to win all four Grand Slams twice. The world number one dropped the first two sets, then comfortably levelled before the 19-year-old Italian retired in the final set. Djokovic’s 6-7 (7/9), 6-7 (2/7), 6-1, 6-0, 4-0 win set up a last-eight clash with Matteo Berrettini, another Italian, who progressed after Roger Federer’s withdrawal. Djokovic, the 2016 champion and chasing a 19th major, was facing his earliest exit in Paris since 2009 when 19-year-old Musetti stormed through the first two sets, hitting blistering winners and finding the acutest of angles. Rafael Nadal also made the last eight, beating Jannik Sinner 7-5 6-3 6-0.
The 13-time French Open champion recovered from an opening-set wobble in which he twice dropped serve to trail 5-3 to comfortably see off the Italian 18th seed and extend his winning run in Paris to 35 sets. Djokovic’s victory, meanwhile, marked the fifth occasion he has overturned a two-set deficit to win at a Slam. But he was clearly frustrated for a lengthy portion of the afternoon by Musetti, who was able to match him shot-for-shot in the opening stages. The teenager began to struggle with stomach cramps and back pain and, after winning just four points in the fourth set, took a medical time-out before retiring after losing 13 successive games. “I like to play young guys in the best-of-five because even at two sets down, I feel I still have my chances,” Djokovic said.
“I have won most of my five-setters and that experience helps. It’s unfortunate for him to have to retire but I could see he was struggling physically.”
