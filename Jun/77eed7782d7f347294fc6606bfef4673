The national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Thursday, congratulated the governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, and his deputy, Hon. Lucky Aiyedatiwa, over the Court of Appeal judgement affirming their victory in the governorship election in the state.  Tinubu, who said the appellate court’s verdict was a clear endorsement of the sound judgment of the Election Petition Tribunal, advised Akeredolu to place partisan politics aside for a moment.  In a statement by his media aide, Tunde Rahman, Tinubu noted that the Appeal Court decision stands for the vital proposition that the rule of law serves to protect the sovereign will of the people when expressed in free and honest elections.  According to him, “By this judgement, the appellate court clearly shows that Governor Akeredolu and Deputy Governor Aiyedatiwa were the candidates whom the people of Ondo choose to pilot their affairs for the next four years.  “The confidence the people repose in the Akeredolu administration has been well earned and should be wholly respected. I urge Governor Akeredolu to continue to strive and do his utmost in the service of his state and for the welfare of all the people therein, politico friend and foe alike.  “The opposition PDP and its candidate, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), have exercised their constitutional rights by challenging the election results via the legal process. They have fought a good fight but that process and fight are now over.  “It’s time to now place partisan politics on the shelf for the moment so that these former political contestants can join hands as much as possible for the good and development of Ondo State.”  Tinubu, however, advised Governor Akeredolu “to be a unifier who casts his net widely and also provides an open door to all who sincerely want to contribute to the wellbeing of the state and its proud and decent people.”
