I also told you that I don’t talk carelessly on Facebook, Whatsapp and all those things. I am not a fan of it. But the day I get angry and I choose to talk, it will shock everybody,” Tanimu was seen saying in the video. “I want to sound this warning to all those of you calling my wife’s phone number, asking her to park her things from my house, that you want to marry her or that I don’t have anything to give her,” he added
