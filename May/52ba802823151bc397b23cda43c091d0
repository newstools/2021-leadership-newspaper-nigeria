An independent survey conducted by an international policy and governance think-tank, the Council on African World Affairs, has rated one of the 16 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s aspirants for the coming November 6, Anambra state governorship election, Mr Valentine Ozigbo as the most likely person to win the governorship election. In a statement made available to newsmen yesterday, the Washington DC-based Council on African World Affairs said its prediction was based on the results of survey, which it sponsored an Abuja consulting firm, Eagle Badger to conduct on the coming governorship election in Anambra State. The executive director of the think tank, Professor JP Afam Ifedi who signed the statement, said that as a non-partisan organisation, it is invested in deepening and strengthening democracy in Nigeria by supporting political institutions in the conduct of credible election in the country. “We have been providing these non-partisan interventions in Nigerian elections, and we aim to provide research-based, evidence-based information that will guide policymakers and educate Nigerian voters,” Professor Ifedi said. “Plans are in progress to carry out similar research exercises for the upcoming Osun and Ekiti gubernatorial elections, as well as the 2023 general elections. The research for 2023 is ongoing, and the first report will be out in a couple of weeks. “This is to provide credible empirical information to the public and the political parties and institutions with a view of expanding the democratic space and making Nigeria better. “We commissioned this survey for all the political parties participating in the Anambra 2021 governorship election, and what we are giving to you today is the report on the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) report, which is the first to come out,” Ifedi, a political economist who teaches at Howard University, said.
