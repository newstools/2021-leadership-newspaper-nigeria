Organised Private Sector (OPS) in collaboration with the federal government will offer protection to over nine million Nigerian children under the At-Risk Children Project (ARC-P). The project will offer protection to the unprotected children who deal daily with violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation and exclusion, the special adviser to the president on social investments, Mrs Maryam Uwais, has said. Uwais while unveiling the programme, a strategic national response to address the problem of vulnerable children coordinated by her office to the Organised Private Sector (OPS) in Lagos, she said ARC-P’s vision is to comprehensively address cross-cutting concerns of at-risk children and provide them with a life of dignity. In a statement she issued, Uwais said, “In the family and communities, children should be fully protected so they can survive, grow, learn and develop to their fullest potential,” she said. The project’s mission, Uwais added, “is to facilitate programmes that will ensure the integration of at-risk children and young adults by creating opportunities for skills and empowerment to reduce their vulnerabilities”. She further disclosed that ARC-P would nurture children with dignity and respect, raise equal citizens and bridge the poverty gap. Responding, some of the companies, including Lafarge Africa Plc, ANAP Holdings, Airtel Nigeria, International Finance Corporation, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Wema Bank, Aliko Dangote Foundation, FBN Quest Trustees, StanbicIBTC, InterSwitch, Murtala Muhammed Foundation and Accelerex Network, all commended the initiative.
