BY OLSUHOLA BELLO  | Stakeholders in the Nigerian capital market say they expect the mixed trend which dominated the equities market last week to continue as more corporate earnings are released in the face of rising fixed income yields, oil prices and high dividend yields. However, market analysts say  the pullbacks offer bargain hunters and income investors another opportunity to reposition, while more companies release their full-year numbers to support recovery. This is based on the fact that the rising fixed income yields may not be enough to scare all investors away from the equity market. Speaking to LEADERSHIP Sunday, the chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr Ambrose Omordion, said, investors should target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities. He stated that, “this is especially given the rising oil prices that have so far supported the economy and equity market, despite the seeming improvement in the fixed income yield which had remained at negative real rate of return due to the subsisting high inflation.” Going forward, he said, the market will be propelled by expected 2020 full earnings reports, until the March edition of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting this week. Adding, the NSE’s index action and indicators are in divergence on a low traded volume and positive buying sentiments. According to Omordion, “we expect the domestic equities market to remain weak as yields in the fixed income market trend upward, especially for 364-day bill which rose to seven per cent. Hence, we expect investors to use the opportunity to hunt for bargains given the lower re-entry prices.” In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected the domestic equities market to remain weak as yields in the fixed income market trend upward, especially for 364-day bill which rose to seven per cent. Hence, we expect investors to use the opportunity to hunt for bargains given the lower re-entry prices. Cordros Capital Limited said: “in the week ahead, we expect investors’ attention to be focused on the outcome of the MPC meeting as they seek clarity on the direction of yields in the fixed income market. “We expect the choppy trading pattern that played out this week to persist in the week ahead, as investors continue to cherry-pick dividend-paying stocks and at the same time remain cautious about leaving gains in the market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” On its part, Afrinvest Limited expects sentiments in the equities market to remain bearish as investors’ focus tilt towards fixed-income instruments.
