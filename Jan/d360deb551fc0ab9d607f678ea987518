BY ISAIAH BENJAMIN.Kaduna The ongoing faceoff between the Kaduna State House of Assembly Speaker, Rt. Hon Yusuf Zailani and Senator Uba Sani representing Kaduna Central District has attracted public attention with good governance monitoring groups raising bias alert against APC Chairmen of the seven local government areas that make up the Kaduna Central. Following the escalation of verbal warfare between the camps of the Speaker and the Senator, Chairmen of the seven local governments issued a statement calling for the sanction of the Speaker. Sensing a slant in the intervention of the Chairmen that include those of Kajuru, Chikun, Kaduna South, Kaduna North, Igabi, Giwa and Birnin Gwari, the Non Alligned Democracy Monitor challenged the local party leaders on indiscretion. “We are concerned that the local APC chairmen of the seven local governments of the Kaduna Central have caught themselves in political bias involving the slanting and altering of information to make the position of Uba Sani seem more attractive. “Their self-serving set of bias emerged in this context when the chairmen engaged an open inability and deliberate unwillingness to understand and fairly analyze the two politically opposing points of view. “Such bias with apparent roots in the shaping of the chairmen’s individual traits and thinking styles with a gift of Golf cars by Uba Sani, would certainly prove detrimental to the interest of the APC in the long run,” the Group said in a statement signed by its Chairman, Dauda Sani Aliyu. The Group warned the APC Chairmen that such unwarranted and arbitrary show of political bias going beyond simple presentation and decent understanding by favouring a particular political leader would have a lasting impact with drastic effects on future voter behaviour towards the Party and consequent political outcomes. “This shameful show of lack of political neutrality or the barefaced violation of political neutrality by the seven local party leaders only goes to confirm accusations against them of insatiable greed for personal gains over the general interest of the Party,” the Group said.
