By IGHO OYOYO The executive secretary of the National Universities Commission, Professor Abubakar Rasheed is at the forefront of efforts to produce a revised curriculum for the Nigerian university system that will produce better quality graduates that are nationally relevant and globally competitive in a post-pandemic era. The process, which started in 2019 and is expected to be completed in September 2021, is a key part of the 2019-2023 Blueprint for the Rapid Revitalisation of the Nigerian University System.
