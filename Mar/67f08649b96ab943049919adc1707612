By ABDULLAHI OLESIN | Following the agitation for the return of grant- aided mission schools to their former owners, the Muslim  Stakeholders Of Kwara State has urged the  Kwara State government to stand by the rule of law in taking a final decision on the issue. President, All Baptist Schools, Rev. Victor Adebayo Dada had in the wake of government’s approval for the use of hijab by Muslim female students last week asked the government to return 10- grant aided mission schools in the state to their former owners.
