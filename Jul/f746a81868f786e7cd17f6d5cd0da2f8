Former military head of state, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, has described as heartless the spate of kidnapping and banditry on school children across the northern states, saying the development has taken education back by 20 years. He stated this when he received the Niger State chairman of the Campaign for Democracy and Human Rights Advocacy, Comrade Abdullahi Mohammed Jabi, on a courtesy visit at his Uphill residence in Minna, Niger State capital. General Abdulsalami described the action of those behind the kidnapping of children from their schools as wicked and godless, praying that God will touch their hearts to stop the nefarious activities. He said the incessant activities of the bandits was a setback to educational and socio-economic development of the north. “These people don’t even fear God.  These people don’t know what they are doing; their actions have taken education, especially in the northern part of the country 20 years back. I hope they will realise this and stop what they are doing,” he declared He reiterated that the kidnappers and their collaborators are oblivious of the destruction on the economy and the education of the North, insisting that some heartless people keep kidnapping people, especially school children “as if these people don’t have their own children.” Apparently referring to the recent abduction of Tanko Salihu Islamiyya school Tegina pupils, he said: “I wonder if they will like their children to be treated the way they are treating other people’s children in the name of a money-making venture. I hope and believe that God will touch their hearts one day to stop this wicked act. “I know we are facing serious security challenges in the country and I want to appeal to Nigerians to let’s join hands and fight these common enemies of the people.” School Attack, One Too Many(Opens in a new browser tab)
