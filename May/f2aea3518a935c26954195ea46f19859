The founder and host of popular breakfast show on radio, Brekete Family, Ahmed Isah, has apologised for hitting a woman, who was accused of setting her niece’s head ablaze in Abuja. The woman, identified as Susan, was brought to Isah’s Human Rights Radio station having inflicted severe injury on the young girl’s head. On interrogating Susan on his daily live show and having said she had no reason to attack the small girl, Isah got infuriated and hit the lady to the amazement of many, who questioned the rationale behind his action. Shortly after Isah’s spontaneous action, the video clip circulated by BBC Eye went viral on the social media eliciting mixed reactions. However, Isah, who is popularly known as Ordinary President, on Wednesday appealed to his listeners around the world to forgive him of such action. “I am sorry for slapping her, I want all our listeners globally to forgive me. I am human bound to make mistakes. I am just being emotional, I am sorry,” Isah said on live radio programme. He also apologised to everyone he might have offended in one way or the other.
