Lagos Public Procurement Agency yesterday said it had integrated a total of 55 Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the state on the e-procurement platforms to enhance the ease of doing business with the state government within the first two years of the Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu administration in the state. The Lagos head of service, Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, made this revelation while speaking at a press briefing organised to mark the second year anniversary of the Administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in office. Muri-Okunola explained that while 45 of the 97 MDAs approved for integration by the governor in 2021 had been brought on board in the first two quarters of the year, the remaining 52 MDAs would be integrated on the e-procurement platform in batches within the remaining two quarters of the year. He further stated that the e-procurement system is a technical innovation with enormous benefits for all stakeholders, adding that the system will reduce to the barest minimum all forms of physical interaction between the Procuring Entities or the Procurement Agency and contractors, suppliers and service providers as “it offers contractors, service providers or suppliers the opportunity to do business with the state government  and its MDAs online, using the computer or the smart phone from the comfort of their homes or offices.” He reiterated that the e-procurement system would enhance accountability, transparency, competitiveness and value for money, thereby contributing to the realization of the objectives of the state government’s policy on the ease of doing business with the state government. He stressed that in a bid to enable contractors, suppliers and service providers make relevant payments to the coffers of the state government with relative ease using online payment platforms, the Lagos State Public Procurement Agency has entered into effective collaboration with some MDAs and some private sector organisations, including the State Treasury Office (STO), Central Internal Audit Office, Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS), Ministry of Science and Technology and Alpha Beta Consulting (ABC), among others. Muri-Okunola maintained that to ensure the deepening of the public procurement system and effective management of the e-procurement system in the state, intensive training and capacity development programmes were organised for procurement personnel saddled with the responsibility of operating and managing the public
