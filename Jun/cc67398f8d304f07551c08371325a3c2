Alhaji Usman Baba (Ubale) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been declared winner of the bye-election for the Sabon Gari State Constituency seat in Kaduna State House of Assembly. Declaring the results, the returning officer (RO), Dr Mohammed-Nuruddin Musa, announced that Usman Baba was duly elected having satisfied the requirements of the law and polled the highest valid votes cast of 9,113. He defeated his closest contender from the All Progressives Congress (APC), Malam Musa A. Musa, who polled 7,404 votes. The returning officer also announced that Anas Abdullahi of the ADC polled 62 votes, Chindo Ibrahim of ADP polled 61 votes and Musa Halilu of PRP polled 305 votes. Alhough there was low turnout of eligible voters during the election, voters, however, conducted themselves in a peaceful and orderly manner throughout the election. LEADERSHIP recall that the Sabon Gari seat initially occupied by the former Speaker of the House, Hon. Aminu Shagali of the APC, was declared vacant in April, after he was alleged to have absconded from activities of the Assembly for more than 360 days following his removal as the Speaker of the House.
