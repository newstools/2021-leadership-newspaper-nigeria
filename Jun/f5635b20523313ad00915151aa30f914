The federal government has extended the deadline for NIN-SIM data verification to the July 26, 2021. The decision to extend the deadline was made after a request by stakeholders on the need to consolidate the enrolment and NIN-SIM verification process following the rapid increase in the number of enrolment systems across the country. As at June 28, 2021, a total of 5,410 enrolment systems are now available across the country and this would significantly ease the NIN enrolment process and subsequent linkage of NIN to SIM. The federal government has approved the extension as part of its effort to make it easier for its citizens and residents to obtain the NIN, while urging Nigerians to take advantage of the extension. A statement from NIMC made available to LEADERSHIP today stated that, there are now a total of 57.3 million unique NIN enrolments, with average of 3 to 4 SIMs per NIN. With the great number of enrolment centres across the country, NIMC said, every citizen and legal resident should be able to obtain their NINs. The minister of communications and digital economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, while reacting on behalf of the Federal Government, appreciated Nigerians for their patience and compliance with the federal governmentâ€™s directive on the NIN-SIM registration exercise. Similarly, the executive vice chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Prof Umar Garba Dambatta, and the Director-General/CEO of that National Identity Management Commission, Engr Aliyu Azeez, urged citizens and legal residents to make sure they use the opportunity to complete the process of enrolment and verification.
