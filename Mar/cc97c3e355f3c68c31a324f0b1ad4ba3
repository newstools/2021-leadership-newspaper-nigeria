There was a robust question and answer session. where many of the governors commended our modest efforts and urged their colleagues to abide by the resolution. “Some of the governors also emphasized the need for the operators to ensure that they repair the roads that they damage during the installation of fibre optic cables. I use this forum to urge all operators to ensure that this is done,” the minister said.
