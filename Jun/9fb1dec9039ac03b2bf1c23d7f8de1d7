Fidelity Bank Plc said, 15 of its customers will have the opportunity to win N39 million at the final draw of the Get Alert in Millions Campaign (GAIM) Season 4 savings promo. The savings promotion, which is specifically aimed at promoting the culture of saving among Nigerians, is one of the bank’s many initiatives aimed at rewarding new and existing customers for their unwavering loyalty and patronage. Although the promotion was halted in 2020 due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and the resulting global lockdown, hundreds of Nigerians have benefited from this unique reward scheme in which lucky customers are credited with millions of naira and consolation prizes via a draw system. The chairman, Promo Committee, Fidelity Bank Plc, Mr. Richard Madiebo, expressed his delight at the resumption of the savings promotion, stating that, the campaign seeks to reward customers for their loyalty and patronage. According to Madiebo, for the past twelve years, the bank has empowered new and existing customers, providing an avenue for many to change their fortunes through its savings promo.  He stated that the bank takes pride in keeping its promises, adding that, the lender would continue to look out for innovative ways to satisfy and enrich its customers across the nation.  “As we wind down on the 4th season of the GAIM promo, we are elated at the prospect of not only driving financial inclusion across Nigeria, but also at the unique opportunity to enrich the lives of our customers especially in times of economic uncertainties,” noted Madiebo.
