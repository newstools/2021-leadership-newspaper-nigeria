BY ISAIAH BENJAMIN One of the abducted students of Greenfield University in Kaduna State has been released by the bandits. Although the police and government authorities were yet to confirm the development, the mother of the student, Lauritta Attahiru, confirmed the release of her son to Channels Television, on Tuesday. She, however, refused to give details of how her son was released and whether a ransom was paid or not. Some of the others parents said that the student was released on Saturday after his mother, who is a wife of a retired Army officer from Plateau State negotiated and paid ransom to the bandits privately before they released her son on Saturday. The parents had earlier informed that the bandits have been negotiating with them individually, asking each of them to pay as high as N20million, before they eventually demanded a bulk of N100 million and 10 motorcycles on Monday, May 3. The parents, however, appealed to the government and Nigerians to come to their aid so that their children will be rescued alive from the hands of their abductors. With the release of the student, the fate of the remaining 16 students still hangs in the balance even as the bandits threatened to kill them if their parents and government fail to pay the N100 million ransom and also provide the motorcycles. LEADERSHIP reports that the release of one of the students followed an earlier threat by their abductors to kill the remaining 17 students in their custody if their parents and the state government fail to pay the sum of N100 million as ransom by Tuesday, May 4, 2021. This was disclosed by some of the parents of the abducted students on Monday.
