The Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) has announced plan to collaborate with the Ghana Shippers Authority (GSA) to promote trade facilitation in Africa. Speaking at the press briefing in Abuja, the executive secretary, NSC, Hassan Bello, said the collaboration has become necessary to protect shippers in the region from undue challenges such as over taxation. He also said the collaboration will lead to efficiency in service delivery and ensuring that both countries export their goods and earn foreign exchange without hindrances. According to him, “we are looking at the need to protect our shippers and ensure that what they pay for are for trade and nothing more. “We are also looking at efficiency in trade and service delivery within the Africa region. It beholds on the Shippers’ Council of Africa to come together to protect the trade facilitation in Africa.” Meanwhile, the chief executive of the Ghana Shippers Authority, Benonita Bismarck, assured the NSC of the authority’s readiness to collaborate with Nigeria. She noted that Africa Shippers’ Council has a role to protect African trade and Ghana will work with Nigeria to achieve that. She also said that since the establishment of GSA in 1974, it has become necessary to change the framework to reflect the current realities and Ghana will learn from the ways Nigeria Shippers’ Council reshaped its laws to reflect the current realities.
