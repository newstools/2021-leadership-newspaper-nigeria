The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has urged Nigerians to beware of fraudsters, who have been scamming applicants and promising them jobs. The spokesperson of the agency, Femi Babafemi, said the NDLEA is presently investigating at least three telephone/bank account numbers linked to members of the job scam syndicate, as intelligence gathered by the agency showed that some criminal elements at the receiving end of the ongoing offensive action by the NDLEA are in the process of using the activities of the job scam syndicate as an instrument of blackmail against the agency and/or its officials using pliable online platforms. He said the agency was alerting the public on the activities of some scammers taking advantage of the recent employment screening exercise to demand payments from shortlisted candidates for narcotic officers and narcotic assistants before they could be employed. According to him, “For the umpteenth time, we will like to reiterate that the agency is not recruiting into any cadre of its workforce. We have just recently concluded the screening exercise for those whose employment process started in 2019. “Any pretence by professional scammers to extort money from anyone especially those who recently participated in the screening exercise should be ignored and their details reported through our social media handles’ direct messages. “Going by the level of investigations into the activities of these scammers so far, members of the public can rest assured that we shall soon bring the criminal elements behind the scam to the open.” Recall that the agency had on May 12, and June 6, 2021 notified the public and job seekers to be wary of messages from persons claiming to be acting on behalf of NDLEA and/or its officials demanding payments for employment.
