Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, has revealed that Nigerian international footballer, Kelechi Iheanacho, has “cut a soap” for him. The slang, “cut a soap for me”, is a popular saying in Nigeria which translates to asking a supposedly rich person to share the secret of his or her fortunes with another person. The Super Eagles and Leicester City forward had visited the Kogi governor at the latter’s Abuja residence on Thursday. Governor Bello, who described the footballer as a “Senior Man” and as well congratulated him for the recent FA Cup win by his club, took to his official Facebook page to announce Iheanacho’s visit in a rather strange manner in pidgin English. Bello wrote: “Finally, Senior Man Kells Kelechi Iheanacho don cut soap for me! “It is always a pleasure to meet a teaming, Patriotic, Vibrant #nigerian #Youth. “Congratulations once again on your #facup win. “The future of our great Nation is the Younger Generations. “The time is now. God bless #nigeria.”
