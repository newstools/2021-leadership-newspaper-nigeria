Ubah noted that the party was not behind the crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the state, contrary to insinuations in some quarters. “If other parties are having crisis, it means their processes are not right. As you can see in YPP, we are moving with the speed of light,” he said. He recalled that YPP gave APGA and PDP a hot chase and came out victorious during the Anambra South senatorial election in the state. ”I am representing my constituency well in the Senate.

We are expecting a smooth election and ready to take over the governorship seat in Anambra,” he said. On the unrest in the South-East, he said, “Election is a constitutional process that must be met and the election will be conducted without chaos. YPP has the blessing of God and we mean well for Anambra.”
