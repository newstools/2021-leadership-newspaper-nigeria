By Francis Okoye, Maiduguri The Chairperson Borno state Emergency Management Agency ( BOSEMA ), Mrs Yabawa Kolo has appealed to the local and international donors as well as kindhearted individuals not to be tired of providing food support to over 1.5 million Borno internally displaced persons (IDPs). She therefore called for more support from the donors especially in the area of food items to ameliorate the sufferings of the displaced persons. Kolo who made the call yesterday while taking delivery of 3000 bags of grains  donated by the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) at BOSEMA central store in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, noted that every single support will go a long way in saving lives. She said :”It is not our wish that this should drag this long, but here we are dealing with an insurgency that is dragging to its twelfth year. “We all are praying for a quick end to this so that we all can go back to our normal lives of farming and animals breeding. Before now our people are known for the cultivation of all kinds of grains and wheat as well as rice. ” We still hope that one day, we would go back to those days of peace”, the BOSEMA Boss added. ECOWAS presented the grains to the Nigerian government through the ministry of humanitarian affairs for onwards distribution to folks in need in five states. The SEMA Chairperson said the grains are already in their way to Damasak for onward distribution to returned refugees from the Niger Republic. Continuing , She said : His Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara  Zulum, has given us a directive that the grains should immediately be moved to Damasak because the population there are in dire need. And we have complied accordingly. The governor has also approved that additional food grains should be added for them.”  End
