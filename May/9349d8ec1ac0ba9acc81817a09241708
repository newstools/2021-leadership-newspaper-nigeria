President, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Dr Bayo Olugbemi has called on the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation ( NDIC) to partner with the Institute to drive advocacy and consumers education. Olugbemi made the call during a courtesy visit to the managing director/CEO of NDIC in Abuja.
