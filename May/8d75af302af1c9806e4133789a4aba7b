BY BERNARD TOLANI DADA | Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has said everyone involved in the death of 26-year-old Miss Iniobong Umoren will be punished according to laws of the land. Umoren was allegedly abducted, raped and murdered by Uduak Frank Akpan During a condolence visit to late Umoren’s family yesterday in Oruk Anam local government area, the governor said the state government would not interfere with police investigation and expressed confidence in the ability of the police to ensure that justice is served in the matter. Represented at the event by the secretary to the state government (SSG), Dr. Emmanuel Ekuwem, Governor Emmanuel expressed pain over the gruesome manner in which the innocent girl who had gone out in search of a responsible means of livelihood met her untimely death. He said the incident was at variance with the state government’s efforts at encouraging the youths to be engaged in profitable ventures, especially as the deceased was awaiting her call-up letter for the mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Responding on behalf of the family, the elder brother of the deceased, Mr. Ukeme Umoren, expressed shock over the loss of their sister who had just concluded her university education. “She decided to look for a job to make a living, to cater for her needs before leaving for the mandatory national service. I appeal to the state government to ensure that justice takes its course, by bringing all the perpetrators to book. ”I thank the governor for taking personal interest in this case and I appeal that the family should not be abandoned,” Umoren said.
