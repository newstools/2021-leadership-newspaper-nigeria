BY KINGSLEY OKOH | Promasidor Nigeria and Ekiti State government has reiterated commitment to strengthen backwards integration policy to boost dairy production in the country with the delivery of 250 pregnant heifers from the United States of America (USA) to strengthen local content of dairy production. To this end, Ekiti State government and Promasidor Nigeria took delivery  of 250 pregnant heifers from US on 22, April, 2021 which is the second batch of heifers arriving the farm after the first  arrival on February 10, 2021. Through this development, Ikun Dairy farm will explore the backward integration policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to support the needed growth to drive local contents of dairy production at Ikun Dairy farm. The company noted that it would make the dairy farm a model for backward integration on a commercial scale, adding that, upon calving, the milk production on the farm is expected to produce an average of 20 litres of milk per day. The company, in a statement yesterday, promised to revamp the moribund Ikun Dairy Farm in line with the federal government’s policy on backward integration which was initiated by CBN. While stressing that this will bring to fruition the efforts of Ekiti state government and Promasidor Nigeria to ensure that all issues with landowners were resolved and farmers granted full access to land use, the company also said it would ensure the connection of the farm to the national grid for  regular power supply. He added that, with the immense support from the CBN, it would ensure access to facilities to boost investment on the farm and the smooth importation of the heifers to the country.
