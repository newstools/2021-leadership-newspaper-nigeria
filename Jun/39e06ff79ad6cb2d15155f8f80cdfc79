Ahead of the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State, some aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have predicted doom for All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). They said power of incumbency won’t safe APGA which is currently governing the state, noting that the people of the state are ready for a change. The politicians made this assertion Monday while speaking with journalists at the National Secretariat of the party, Abuja, where they had gone to submit their Governorship Nomination Forms. One of the auspirants, Dr Chidozie Nwankwo, said his reputation having being the head of the biggest markets in Onitsha “The legacy I left when I was the leader of the main market supersedes any influence APGA has in Anambra state”. Another aspirant, Arch. Geoff Onyejegbu while speaking about his aspiration also advised the party on the form of primary that would give the APC an edge at the poll, saying he would subscribe to the kind of primary that will bring peace and unity. On his part, Rev. Godwin Okonkwo, who is also an aspirant, called for unity among all aspirants to be able to defeat the sitting APGA and thereby bring the much promised change to the people of the state.
