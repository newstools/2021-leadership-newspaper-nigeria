More accolades have continued to come the way of Cross River State governor, Sir Ben Ayade, following his decamping to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Expressing excitement at Governor Ayade’s movement, the senior special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said Cross River stands to reap the fruits of the governor’s movement to the APC in the long run. Speaking on the sidelines of the award of the Governor of the Year on Agro-Industrialization on Ayade by the Blueprint newspapers at the Congress Hall of the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, last week, Garba Shehu said: “I will just say we are excited about his coming to the APC.” The presidential spokesman who said the governor has a lot to bring to the table, noted that “Ayade is a man of huge intellectual capacity and I think in terms of governance, he is the best.”
