As part of the efforts to eradicate intra-city traffic gridlock, Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun on Wednesday, commissioned the 2.1 kilometers Lantoro-Elite-Idi-Aba Road in Abeokuta, the state capital. The governor, while commissioning the road leading to the home of the first civilian deputy governor in the state, late Pa Sesan Soluade, said the road which was chosen for reconstruction by his administration in conjunction with the Community Development Associations, traditional rulers and other stakeholders, would drastically reduce travel time and resolve traffic gridlock. He noted that the road was among the first set of road projects initiated by this administration as part of its avowed commitment to the implementation of its Infrastructural Development Pillar. The governor noted that the road was executed through direct labour under the watch of Ogun State Public Works Agency (OGPWA) to ensure minimal cost without compromising the quality of the job. He emphasised that, “The method provided direct employment to the youth in the project catchment area and engaged local suppliers of materials, thus supporting our agenda of socio-economic development of the state and individual prosperity of citizens. “This project, Oke lantoro-Elite-Idi-Aba road, is 2.1 km in length. It will serve as an effective alternative and bye pass to those who are coming from either Lantoro or Obantoko area or Asero and going to Idi-Aba or Ajebo road. They would not need to go through Iyana Mortuary Junction. “This will not only serve the purpose of reducing travel time and resolving traffic gridlock, it will also enhance the quality of life of residents around this area and increase the value of properties and become a source of prosperity to the owners, which is a major anchor of our governance vision,” Abiodun stated.
