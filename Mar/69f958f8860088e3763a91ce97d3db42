BY CHIKA IZUORA  | Nigeria has abundant gas resources which, if harnessed, will meet the energy demand of over 350 million people and the industrial needs in the West African sub-region. According to the newly inaugurated president of the Nigeria Gas Association (NGA), Ed Ubong, “Nigeria, which ranks as the 9th largest gas reserve in the world and clearly the largest in West Africa, needs to develop this resource base and connect the existing local supply and demand with physical and virtual pipeline infrastructure, while also exploring closer integration of roads, seaports and rail infrastructure.” Speaking, at the just concluded NGA’s 12th International Conference and Industry Awards in Lagos last week, Ubong who is also the managing director, Shell Nigeria Gas Limited, however, advocated an improved investment climate for the gas sector to further develop infrastructure along the gas value chain and enable the expansion of the gas networks to cover the West Africa countries. Speaking on his vision for NGA, Ubong said the association would continue to promote the utilisation of natural gas as the preferred energy source in Nigeria for the benefit of the nation and the various stakeholders in the Nigerian gas value chain. include: upstream gas producers, transporters, gas-based industries, power generation and distribution companies, virtual pipeline operators, LPG market players, industrial and manufacturing customers and the energy professionals who provide critical support for the sector. “The regulatory framework is a key determinant of success of the gas industry. So, the NGA will continue to work with government and regulators to ensure the right laws are in place to create an enabling environment for the sector to thrive over the next decade. Time is of the essence as the Energy transition is on”, he said.
