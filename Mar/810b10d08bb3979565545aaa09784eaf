President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the release of funds for the payment of itinerant workers engaged under the Special Public Works Programme, the minister of state for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo has said. Mr Keyamo made the disclosure in a tweet via his official Twitter handle on Saturday. The minister said he has directed the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) to commence the processing of payments for the workers engaged in the 774 local government areas. He said, “In order to eliminate fraud and/or double payments, I have also directed that every payment to participants should be made using the BVN of their accounts so we can have an audit trail of every single payment. Those who registered with different names shouldn’t expect payments. The Federal Government in January, this year flagged off the 774, 000 jobs with each participant expected to receive N20, 000 each in the next three months.
