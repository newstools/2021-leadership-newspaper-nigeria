BY OLUSHOLA BELLO, Lagos With the continued recovery of yields in the fixed income (FI) market, analysts on the Nigerian capital market anticipated a soft equity market trading this week. Trading on the market will commence on Tuesday , April 6, 2021 following the public holiday declared by the federal government of Nigeria to commemorate the 2021 Easter celebrations; Good Friday April 2, 2021 and tomorrow, Easter Monday,  April 5, 2021. Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited stated that, “heading into the second quarter, we expect investors to rebalance their portfolios based on an assessment of corporate earnings released during first quarter, 2021 whilst keeping an eye on the movement of yields in the FI market.” According to Cordros, “considering that the full year 2020 earnings season has run its course, we now expect investors’ sentiment to be influenced by developments in the macroeconomic landscape and corporate actions. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited said: “this week, we expect the domestic equities market to further trade sideways as investors move their funds to the money market as 364-day bills becomes more attractive at eight per cent and present trading opportunities. Hence, we expect investors bargain hunt for stocks with good fundamentals.” In the just concluded trading week, the equities market was dominated with bearish sentiment, hence, reversing previous week’s gain despite the influx of relatively positive audited full year 2020 financial results. Weak reactions trailed the stock market as rates and yields further rise in the fixed income space, 364-day bill hit eight per cent.

On market outlook, the chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr Ambrose Omordion expected the mixed trend to continue as portfolio reshuffling and adjustment commences ahead of Q1 numbers and economic data in the face of rising dividend and fixed income market yields. The pullbacks, he added, offer bargain hunters and income investors another opportunity to reposition in high dividend yields and undervalued stocks, while quarterly numbers to support recovery, saying this is based on the fact that the rising fixed income yields may not be enough to scare all investors away from the equity space. Omordion urged investors to target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities, stating this is especially given the rising oil prices that have so far supported the economy and equity market, despite the seeming improvement in the fixed income yield which had remained at negative real rate of return due to the subsisting high inflation. “However, the strong and faster recovery may continue, depending on market forces, going forward, as propelled by 2020 full numbers and expected 2021 Q1 earnings reports, until the next MPC meeting in May. “The NSE’s index action and indicators are heading in the same direction on a low traded volume and positive buying sentiments in the midst of rising yield in bond and treasury bill (TB),” he pointed out.
