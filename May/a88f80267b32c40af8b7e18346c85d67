The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Reconciliation Committee and Strategic Committee, led by former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has reconciled the feuding camps in the Lagos State chapter of the party. The camps led by Chief Bode George, and state chairman of the party, Deji Doherty, agreed an end to their tussle and promised to unite ahead of the future elections in the state. LEADERSHIP learnt that the Saraki committee met the Lagos PDP stakeholder at Southern Sun Hotel, Ikoyi for four hours. Other members of the panel include former Governors Liyel Imoke (Cross River), Ibrahim Dankwambo (Gombe), and Ibrahim Shema (Katsina). Others are a former leader of the House of Representations, Mulikat Adeola-Akande and Linus Okorie. While PDP stakeholders in Lagos at the reconciliation meeting included the secretary, Muiz Dosunmu, former acting national secretary of the party, Remi Akitoye, Senator Kofo Akerele-Bucknor, Lai Ogunbambi, Uthman Shodipe, and Otunba Okanlawon. LEADERSHIP gathered that after a lengthy discussion about the protracted crisis, both sides agreed for Chief George to be recognised as the party leader in the state. However, speaking with journalists after the parley, Saraki admonished the warring party chieftains to eschew bitterness and imbibe forgiveness in the party’s interest. He said: “We’ve seen commitment of PDP members in Lagos to bury their differences and understand that the call of majority of Lagosians to have PDP in government is more important than their own individual differences. “We have reconciled the party leaders today and they are ready to dissipate their energies to push the agenda of the PDP for Lagos State. We are happy to see that.” He added: “We must present ourselves as a serious party. The differences for many months have been buried and that shows people are committed now to make the party attractive to new people who want to join the party.”
