By Michael Oche, with Agency Report  Barely 24 hours after promising a peaceful transition of power, United States President Donald Trump declared yesterday that he will not attend the inauguration of Democratic president-elect, Joe Biden, on the 20th of this month.   “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,” Trump wrote on Twitter.   There have been discussions at the White House about Trump leaving Washington on January 19, a source familiar with the matter said, adding that the outgoing president is expected to travel to his Florida resort. In the past, three outgoing presidents – John Adams in 1801, John Quincy Adams in 1829 and Andrew Johnson in 1869 – refused to attend their successors’ inaugurations. After months of his refusing to commit to a peaceful transition of power, President Trump late Thursday said he would prepare for the administration of President-elect Joe Biden. Trump in a statement called for “healing and reconciliation” and said he would turn his focus to the transition, in a message that appeared designed to quell growing alarm among even his closest allies and aides. “A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20th,” Trump said, adding that “my focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.” He further stated: “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th”. “I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!” Rioters had invaded the US Capitol Hill on Thursday. Four people were killed and at least 52 arrested before order was restored in an event that marked the first time the seat of American democracy had been breached since 1814.
