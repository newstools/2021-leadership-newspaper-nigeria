After weeks and months of uncertainty, LEADERSHIP can now authoritatively report that the ruling All Progressives Congresses (APC) will begin its congresses at the end of this month. The party has fixed its ward congress for July 31, 2021, and
this will be followed by local government and state congresses. This process leading to this was contained in a letter with reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/19/021/40 dated 11th July 2021 which the party wrote to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). In the letter, the party statutorily notified the electoral body that it would commence congresses on July 31, 2021. The letter was jointly signed by Chairman, Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Gov. Mai Mala Buni and Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoehede. The letter reads: “Further to our letter referenced APC/NHDOINEC/19/021/39 dated 6th July 2021 on the above subject, we write to please inform you that the Congresses will now commence on 31st July 2021 starting with the Ward Congress, Local Government and State Congress will follow sequentially upon the completion of the Ward Congress.” The CECPC will meet on Tuesday to ratify dates for other congresses and propose a date for the national convention, which will be conveyed to President Muhammadu Buhari for approval. Recall that the party had on July 6, 2021, conveyed to INEC its intention to shift the timeline for the conduct of its congresses and national convention. The earlier timetable by the party had fixed sale of the nomination form for ward congress for 1st to 7th July; inauguration of Ward/LGA Congress Screening/Screening Appeal Committees for 10th July 2021; Ward Congress for 24th July, Local Government Congress for 14th August 2021 and the State Congress for 18th September 2021.
