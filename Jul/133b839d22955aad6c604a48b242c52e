Yusuf described the action as a threat to economic integration in Africa. LEADERSHIP reported on Monday that the government of Republic of Benin stopped Nigeria-bound trucks laden with transit goods from Cote d’ivoire, Ghana and Togo from passing through its border to Nigeria. This development has left over 3,700 Nigeria-bound trucks laden with transit goods worth several billions of naira trapped between Ilakoji, a border between Ghana, Togo and Benin. When contacted for the federal government’s reactions, to the development, an aide to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Ifedayo Sayo, referred our reporter to the Nigeria Customs.
