AFN factional president, Engr Ibrahim Shehu Gusau, is optimistic that Nigerian athletes will be able to qualify for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo ahead of today’s National Trials holding at the Yaba College of Technology Sports Complex on Thursday. Speaking after he was returned for another four-year term, Gusau said the athletes can still surmount the political issues that bedeviled the federation and qualify for the Olympic Games in Tokyo. The National trials’ objective is to ensure qualification for the Games. “We also hope that athletes who are yet to qualify for the games, especially in the relays, get an opportunity to do so,” Gusau said. Sequel to the drama that engulfed the AFN, the president said that his aspiration was to ensure that Nigeria wins at least three gold medals and set new national and Olympics records.
