In a bid to ensure the safety of life and property in the state during the rainy season as a result of silted drains, Akwa Ibom State government has commenced the desilting of major drains in the state The commissioner for environment and solid minerals, Sir Charles Udoh, while flagging off the exercise reiterated the government’s commitment to minimising the incidents of flood to prevent loss of lives and destruction of critical infrastructure. He said government was devoting huge resources to disilting of the drains like it has not been done many years after completion While commending the state governor, Udom Emmanuel, for approving the exercise, he advised the residents to desist from dumping refuse in drains the government had spent so much to construct and maintain. According to the commissioner, the major factor responsible for the menace of flooding is the poor waste management habit of the people who dump refuse in drains. Udoh said the disilting of these drains would help to avert possible disaster which may eventually lead to loss of life and properties. “The outfall drain which collects storm water from Nsikak Eduok catchment area and discharges at Obot Idim outfall has not been desilted for years after completion. Embarking on this exercise further depicts government gestures toward ensuring the safety of life of citizens and residents. “The disilting of major outfall drains in  Nsikak Eduok- Afaha Ibesikpo outfall  and Mbikpong Ikot Edim- Mbiakot outfall  drainages and discharge locations is still ongoing and may last for weeks” he stated.
