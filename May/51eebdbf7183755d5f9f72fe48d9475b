Asked about his months-old marriage and how he is finding his new marital status, MusicbySire whose full name is Olorunsogo Michael Oni, said: “It is not challenging because I not only marry the woman of my dream, but I am also married to a woman the Lord has chosen for me. As the Bible says, he who finds a good wife has found a good thing. I am daily filled with joy. So my marriage gives me joy every day.” Speaking about his wife, Nollywood actress Aisat Iyabode Asamu popularly known as Aishy, he said: “ She is a virtuous woman. Her maternal disposition also gives me the comfort that I am in safe hands.” Marriage, he further hinted, is not going to affect the couple’s creative pursuits. “This is what we both do for a living. What it means is we are going to double our efforts going forward and our fans can expect more from us,” he declared. Musicbysire also voiced his concern about the worsening security situation in the country. The Guilty singer said: “It is about time the government find a way to get serious about arresting this dangerous trend in the country.” Continuing, he said: “The leadership of the country ought to be alive to its responsibility and provide security of lives and properties to its citizens. When we daily face the menace of robbery and kidnapping in our own country, how then can we be confident in the leadership of the country?” He further added: “We have no other country, and not all of us will want to migrate and flee our fatherland. That is why we are begging our leaders, from federal to state to local government to urgently find a way to arrest the dangerous trend of insecurity.”
