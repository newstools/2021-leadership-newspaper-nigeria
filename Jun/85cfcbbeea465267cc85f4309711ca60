Director-general of media to the Adamawa State governor, Solomon Kumanga, has said the best of APC representatives from the state cannot be equated with a council chairman under Governor Ahmadu Umoru Fintiri. Kumangar said under Fintiri’s watch, regarding project delivery, the APC leadership should bow their heads and eat their hearts out. He maintained that the caretaker committee chairman of APC in Adamawa, Ibrahim Bilal’s outburst against the governor may be due to his “unlettered view of His Excellency Rt. Honourable Ahmadu Fintiri’s government”, noting that when the present administration needs a public rating of its stewardship. it will not be considering statements or assertion of the APC leadership at any level. Kumangar, while firing back at the APC leaders’ statement, described the statement credited to the opposition APC caretaker chairman in Adamawa, Ibrahim Bilal as mere “jokes and fallacy” which hold no water.
