By Jonathan Nda-Isaiah  | The presidency has accused Bishop Mathew Kukah of playing partisan politics in his recent criticism of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. The Presidency was reacting to Kukah’s Easter message earlier delivered on Sunday morning. Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a statement on Sunday night, said all citizens have their individual ideologies, even their own versions of truth. The Presidency noted that if anyone profess to being a Man of God as Bishop Kukah does, ideology should not stand in the way of facts and fairness. “Father Kukah has said some things that are inexplicable in his Easter massage. “But, in saying that the Boko Haram terrorism is worse than it was in 2015, he did not speak like a man of God. Kukah should go to Borno or Adamawa to ask the citizens there the difference between 2014 and 2021. Furthermore, the Hijab issue in Kwara State on which he dwelt is a state matter which the courts of the land have adjudicated. They are matters that have appeared in several states as far back as the Obasanjo administration. In all of that, when and where did the name of President Buhari feature? “He is playing partisan politics by dragging the President into it,” the statement said. Shehu further stated an administration that has created a whole Ministry, for the first time in the country’s history, appropriating enormous resources to it, to deal with issues of internally displaced persons, cannot in all rightfulness be accused of not caring for them. “Some of the comments are no more than a sample of the unrestrained rhetoric Fr. Kukah trades in, which he often does in the guise of a homily. “We urge well-meaning citizens to continue to support the ongoing efforts by the administration to secure the country and move it forward,” he stated.
