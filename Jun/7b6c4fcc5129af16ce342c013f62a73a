Financial Times, New York Times, Bloomberg News, and Guardian websites have on Tuesday morning crashed for unknown reasons. Multiple websites operated by news outlets including the Financial Times, CNN, and Bloomberg News were down across the globe. According to Al Jazeera, its Qatar-based media network was also affected. France’s Le Monde newspaper started showing error messages that appeared on the website at around 10:00 GMT. Separately, Amazon.com Inc’s retail website also seemed to face an outage. Amazon was not immediately available to comment. Britain’s Guardian newspaper said its website and app were affected. Sites of some other British news media were also not immediately loading. The UK government’s main website too was unavailable. The White House website had an error message but was later working. The BBC and The New York Times were temporarily inaccessible, but later returned. Messages such as “Error 503 Service Unavailable” and “connection failure” appeared. The issue affecting the websites was not immediately clear. San Francisco-based Fastly – a cloud service company used by many media – acknowledged a problem just before 10:00 GMT. It said in repeated updates on its website it was “continuing to investigate the issue”. About an hour later, the company said: “The issue has been identified and a fix has been applied. Customers may experience increased origin load as global services return.” Many of the websites were slowly coming back online by 11:00 GMT.
