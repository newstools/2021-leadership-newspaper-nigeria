BY OLUSHOLA BELLO, Lagos Market observers expected the nation’s capital market to experience mixed trade performance in the new week, following the low-price attraction and impressive first quarter (Q1) results from companies listed on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited. This is despite the rising yields in the fixed income market, amidst the galloping inflation that is throwing real rate of return into a deeper negative. According to analysts at Afrivest Limited, we expect trading sessions to be a mix of bargain hunting and profit-taking activities this week. Also, Cordros Capital Limited said: “in the week ahead, we do not think the bulls will repeat the flawless victory that ensued last week as the bears are likely to book profit across most counters. “Consequently, we see more of a ‘choppy theme’ as cautious trading takes centre stage ahead of a critical MPC meeting scheduled later in the month. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” While analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited, said: “in the new week, we expect the equities market to sustain its performance as the equities market provides an opportunity for positive real returns despite rising inflation rate.” The chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, stated that, “we expect the mixed trend to continue on profit taking, positioning and portfolio rebalancing on the strength of the numbers released recently amidst the rising infection rate of the novel coronavirus across the globe and the high yields in the fixed income market. “We also expect economic data like the 2021Q1 GDP report, April Purchasing Managers’ Index and inflation among others to reveal the state of the economy and give direction. The banking sector remains attractive on the back of the prevailing low prices, despite the Q1 mixed numbers.” He, however, said, the pullbacks offer bargain hunters and income investors fresh opportunities to reposition in high dividend yields and undervalued stocks, while looking out for quarterly numbers that would support recovery, saying, this is based on the fact that the rising fixed income yields may not be enough to scare all investors away from the equity market. Omordion restated that the way to go is to target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities, adding that, this is especially given the rising oil prices that have so far supported the economy and equity market, despite the seeming improvement in the fixed income yield which had remained at negative real rate of return due to the subsisting high inflation. “However, the strong and faster recovery may continue, depending on market forces, going forward, as propelled by 2020 full numbers and expected 2021 Q1 earnings reports, until the next MPC meeting in May. “Also, the current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for the short, medium and long-term, which is why investors should target fundamentally sound, and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation in the new year,” he said. Meanwhile, last week, despite the shortened trading week due to the public holidays on Wednesday and Thursday to mark the end of holy month of Ramadan and commemorate the Eid al-Fitr celebrations, the bulls regained control of the market following a flawless victory over the bears in the three trading sessions of the week.
