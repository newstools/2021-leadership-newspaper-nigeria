Adesugba said the agency has not contemplated any recruitment exercise yet, adding that the Authority has not also overtly or covertly engaged any recruitment firm to conduct recruitment on its behalf. “This advertorial is, therefore, a calculated falsehood tailored along strategies usually deployed by Yahoo Yahoo guys or internet fraudsters to devour earnings of unsuspecting victims. “The management wishes to advise the general public to discountenance this criminal act and misinformation published by www.careersafrika.com and its affiliates as the action remains in bad taste for probity, transparency and due process that the Authority strives to attain. “NEPZA is an agency of government with respect to standards and due process as it works tirelessly to actualize the Federal Government’s vision of industrialising the nation using free trade zone scheme. “We are, therefore, resolute in carrying out our statutory mandate and this includes a possible legal action against managers of the aforementioned portal and its affiliates if the fake NEPZA recruitment advertorial is not brought down immediately’’. “We shall proceed and take necessary steps to work with the security agencies to hunt and prosecute the scoundrels who are using the name of the Authority to commit such heinous crimes as to defraud Nigerians rightfully wishing to serve their fatherland,” Adesugba said.
