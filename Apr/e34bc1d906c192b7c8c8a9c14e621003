The Bodo Bonny Bridge and roads across Okpobo channels in Rivers State were constructed by Julius Berger at a cost of N120.681 billion. “For this, the government has granted the company a tax waiver of N20 billion,” FIRS said. FIRS chairman, Muhammad Nami represented by coordinating director, Tax Operations Group, Mr. Femi Oluwaniyi urged other corporate bodies across the country to join NLNG and Dangote Nigeria Limited to take advantage of government’s tax credit facility. Oluwaniyi praised NLNG for paying its 2020 tax obligations valued at N130 billion three months ahead of time.
