He explained that the mandate given to AIB-N was based on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the two agencies on July 1, 2020 covering areas of mutual assistance. According to him, “investigators will download and analyse vital information contained in the recorders at the AIB-N’s world class Flight Safety Laboratory, in Abuja.” The crash, which occurred on landing, claimed 11 lives including Gen.
