It is important & timely that they’ve apologized.” In the apology letter signed by Samuel Schumacher, Foreign Editor-In-Chief of Aargauer Zeitung, the newspaper wrote: “In our print edition of Tuesday 9 February 2021 we ran an article on the new head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The article also appeared in our online edition and in other newspapers, Luz erner Zeitung  und St. Galler Tagblatt and their online editions. “In our editorial office, we gave the article about the new head of the world trade organisation the heading ‘This grandmother will be the new chief of the World Trade Organisation.’ This headline was inappropriate and unsuitable. The title  sparked angry reactions from readers. We apologise for this editorial mistake. “The author of the article, Jan Dirk Herbermann, did not write this headline. We did not inform Mr Herbermann about this headline. Therefore Mr Herbermann is not in any way responsible for this headline.
