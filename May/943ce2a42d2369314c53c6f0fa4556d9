By Innocent Odoh, Abuja India has continued to intensify efforts to address the second wave of the COVID-19 that has devastated the country in the last couple of weeks as it gets assistance from countries around the world. A statement issued by the Indian High Commission in Abuja yesterday, raised hope saying that presently, of the total cases, 81.77% cases have recovered, 17.1% are active and cumulative fatality is 1.1%, adding that death rate in the last 2-3 months is well below the 1% mark. “An analysis of daily cases and death shows certain positive developments. The number of cases has been decreasing for two days continuously from over 4 lakhs to 3.68L. This trajectory is visible in deaths as well. However these are very early signs and continuous monitoring is ongoing,” it said. There are however, some causes of concern which would require extra effort, the statement noted. It said there are 12 states which have more than 1lkh active cases and 7 states have active cases from 1L to 50K. It added that in the sample case positivity of states, 22 states have a higher positivity rate than 15%, 9 states with 5 – 15% and 5 states less than 5%. The High Commission also said that India has ramped up vaccinations even as daily recoveries too have begun to see positive developments. “While on 20th April there were 2,59,000 cases against 1,54,000 recoveries, which implies 60% active cases were being added on a daily basis, on 30th April there were 77% recoveries, 2nd May 78% and on 3rd May 82%. It stressed that use of gaseous oxygen for medical use is being planned, saying that next to those industrial units which are making oxygen suitable for medical purpose are temporary COVID-19 centres that will be set up. “Work on 5 facilities has already begun. The plan is to increase these to 10,000 oxygenated beds. There are 1500 oxygen PSA plants which are being developed in an expedited manner. Nitrogen PSA plants are being converted to oxygen PSA plants to supplement the production of oxygen. “14 industries have been identified for this purpose. 37 PSA units have been identified among these industries for this purpose. We are considering either to make temporary hospitals around these or try to shift these plants to hospitals,” the statement said.
