Unknown gunmen on Wednesday afternoon, abducted four male Chinese expatriates working with the Federal Government’s railway project in Odeda local government area of Ogun State. Numbering about eight and all clad in black kaftan, the gunmen allegedly invaded Adeaga/Alaagba village, site of the railway project in Odeda local government area around 6pm where they shot a Police Inspector dead before succeeding in the abduction of the Chinese expatriates handling the Ibadan-Lagos standard gauge railway project. Eye witness at Alaagba village told LEADERSHIP that the abductors seized their victims immediately after disarming the security men attached to them and they headed straight to the forest with their captives. Speaking with LEADERSHIP, the community leader and Baale of Alaagba village, Chief Adekunle Olabamiji, said residents of the rustic border community between Ogun and Oyo state had earlier in the afternoon, observed the presence of some fierce-looking gunmen in the village. LEADERSHIP further gathered that members of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) later in the night launched an unsuccessful hunt for the kidnappers, combing the entire bush in an attempt to possibly apprehend the kidnappers and rescue the victims. When contacted, Ogun State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the abduction, said the command has despatched a team of special tactical unit to roads and forest in Odeda LGA of the State in search of four Chinese workers Oyeyemi, who expressed the optimism that the Chinese expatriates would be rescued unhurt, further explained that primary investigation clearly confirmed that victims were initially ambushed at the construction site prior to the incident.
