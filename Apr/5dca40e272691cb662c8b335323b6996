BY OLUSHOLA BELLO, Lagos Capital market analysts have predicted that this week, the uptick in fixed income (FI) rate may further drive sell-offs in the stock market. Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited said: “with the first quarter (Q1), 2021 earnings season on the horizon, we believe investors will be looking for clues on how corporate earnings will evolve in 2021, given the expected improvement in macroeconomic conditions. “However, we expect the lull in the market to persist as investors remain perturbed by the rising yields in the FI market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” In the new week, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited expects the domestic equities market to trade southwards as yields become attractive in the fixed income space. “Given the bearish sentiment, we expect stocks such as Zenith Bank and Guaranty Trust Bank to further trade at a bargain level as their dividend yields become more attractive amid further fall in their share prices,” they said. The chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr Ambrose Omordion said: “we expect the mixed trend to continue as Q1 corporate earnings start to hit the market from next week in the face of rising yields and portfolio repositioning. Also, the market has failed to move out of its trading range, as index and price action may be the way of discounting the prospects for high cap companies as well as blue chip stocks ahead of earnings season. “The pullbacks offer bargain hunters and income investors another opportunity to reposition in high dividend yields and undervalued stocks, while looking out for quarterly numbers that would support recovery. This is based on the fact that the rising fixed income yields may not be enough to scare all investors away from the equity market.” He added that the way to go is to target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities, saying, this is especially given the rising oil prices that have so far supported the economy and equity market, despite the seeming improvement in the fixed income yield which had remained at negative real rate of return due to the subsisting high inflation. He, however, noted that the strong and faster recovery may continue, depending on market forces, going forward, as propelled by 2020 full numbers and expected 2021 Q1 earnings reports, until the next MPC meeting in May. According to him, the NSE’s index action and indicators are heading in the same direction on a low traded volume and positive buying sentiments in the midst of rising yield in bond and treasury bill (TB). He added that the current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for the short, medium and long-term, which is why investors should target fundamentally sound, and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation in the new year.
