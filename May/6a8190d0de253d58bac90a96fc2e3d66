As part of the programme to celebrate this year’s Children’s Day celebration, Abuja-based real estate firm, T Pumpy Concept Limited has announced a slash in the prices of their lands. With the promo, a 300SQM of land located in Kwali area of Abuja with Certificate of Occupancy is now going for N120k. Speaking on the reason for the promo, the MD/CEO of T Pumpy, Mr. Akintayo Adaralegbe, said the discount is to celebrate the Nigerian child and build a better future for them. His words, “I know some people would ask, how possible it is because the law forbids underage from owning  landed properties, but that is not an issue as parents could sign on behalf of the child. “By the time the child turns 18, the land automatically becomes his or hers. If you recall, when we signed Oreofeoluwa Lawal-Babalola of the Mummy Calm Down fame; as one of our ambassadors, it was the mother that signed on his behalf. “So, with this, even a day-old child can own land through their parents. “The market price of the land is about N400k but we are giving a 150 per cent discount to celebrate our children,” Mr. Adaralegbe said.
