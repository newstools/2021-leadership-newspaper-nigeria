Danbatta, who was represented by the head, online media and special publication, NCC, Grace Ojougboh said there is no doubt that women have been historically central to socio-economic and political development of any nation. He  stressed the need  for nations to focus more on how ICT can be leveraged for increased empowerment for women.
