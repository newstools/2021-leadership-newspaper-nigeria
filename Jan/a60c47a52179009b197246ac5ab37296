She is an alumna of OAU and University of Liverpool, UK where she bagged a Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree in Chemistry and Accounting respectively. The Bank is, however, yet to notify the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for full approval of the appointment. Yemisi Edun will be the 4th female CEO of a commercial bank, following Fidelity Bank, Unity Bank, and Citi Bank The appointment is yet to be published on the website of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, which is typically the first place key executive management appointments for quoted companies are first made public. It will be recalled that Adam Nuru has of recent been embroiled in a crisis involving a former staff of the bank, Moyo Thomas and her late husband, Tunde Thomas.
