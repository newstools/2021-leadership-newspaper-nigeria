The Akwa Ibom State University (AKSU) has disclosed that 14 lecturers have been shown the exit door for sexually abusing students. Although the names of the randy teachers were not mentioned, the vice chancellor of the state-owned university, Prof Nse Essien, said the university will continue to weed out undesirable elements within its ranks. Speaking during a familiarisation visit to the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Akwa Ibom State Council, on Thursday, Prof. Essien disclosed that 38 out of the 42 programmes run by the university have received full accreditation by the National Universities Commission (NUC). Prof. Essien, who will be one-year in office on August 3, also disclosed that everything has been put in place for the commencement of Radio broadcasting by the university. Further to that, the VC, who is a former Commissioner for Education in the state, said that the university unbundled its Mass Communication programme in line with the emerging trend and communication needs of modern society, resulting in the creation of departments of Public Relations, Advertising, Broadcasting and Journalism and Media Studies. While admitting that he had been far away from the NUJ and the media community, the vice chancellor promised to cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship between the NUJ and AKSU. In his remarks, the NUJ chairman, Comrade Amos Etuk, commended the vice chancellor for coming to share his thoughts with journalists and assured him that the new partnership, when given effect, will add value to the rating and standing of the institution. Comrade Etuk suggested to Prof. Essien to use the occasion of his first anniversary in office to showcase the developments in AKSU, under his watch. The vice chancellor was accompanied on the visit by the deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic), Prof. Umoren Umoren and the head of the Directorate of Information, Public Relations and Protocol, Mr. Akaninyene Ibanga.
