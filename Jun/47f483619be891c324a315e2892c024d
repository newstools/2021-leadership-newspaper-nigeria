Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka on Thursday denounced a fake WhatApp posting on the Yoruba State agitation being attributed to him. Soyinka, in a statement titled: “They are back,” urged the public,’’ To ignore the utterances of those contemptible interlopers who lacked the courage of their conviction and thus take to identity theft for the furtherance of their views.’’ He said he did not participate in Facebook, Tweet, Blog, WhatsApp or other offerings of Social Media. According to him, any views he wished to express on national and other issues routinely went through the print media.
