The Gambia has solicited Nigeria’s support to produce the next president of the ECOWAS Commission. This is even as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said Nigeria would continue to support the aspirations and activities of the government and people of The Gambia, especially in ways that promote African brotherhood. According to a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, the vice president spoke when he received at the presidential villa, the special envoy of President Adama Barrow of The Gambia, Hon. Mamadou Tangara, who is also that country’s minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and Gambians Abroad. The special envoy came to personally deliver a message from The Gambian president to President Muhammadu Buhari. Receiving the message on behalf of the president, Osinbajo said, “We strongly remain in support of all of the activities of the government and people of The Gambia and stand with you in all ways. “The Nigerian government remains committed to its relationship with The Gambia. It is a long-standing relationship of brothers of so many years.”
