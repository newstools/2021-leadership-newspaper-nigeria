Manchester City playmaker, Kevin de Bruyne, has said they will feel like failures, if they lost their first-ever Champions League final on Saturday. The Premier League champions take on domestic rivals Chelsea for Europe’s biggest club prize. City have claimed a third Premier League title in four years, but De Bruyne admits they will be seen as underachievers if they lose in Porto. He said: “As players, we understand the magnitude of the game. “If you win, you’re a hero and if you lose, you’re almost a failure, even if you’re not a failure because getting to this stage is incredibly well done by the team and an individual. “But if you don’t win, it will be something you don’t really want to experience.”
