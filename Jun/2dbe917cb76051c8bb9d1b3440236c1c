Justice Ahmed Mohammed of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, has barred the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) from amending the criminal charge it filed against a former Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Andrew Yakubu. The trial judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed, gave the order on Thursday, in a ruling on an application by the EFCC seeking to amend the criminal charge against Mr Yakubu. Justice Mohammed while dismissing the application filed on March 10, held that there is a subsisting judgment delivered on April 24, 2020 wherein the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, ordered the defendants to enter defence on counts 3 and 4 of the charge. “Allowing the EFCC to amend counts 3 and 4, of the criminal charge,” according to the court, “is tantamount to disobeying the subsisting order made by the Court of Appeal on April 24, 2020.” Yakubu was arraigned before Justice Ahmed Mohammed on March 16, 2017 on a six-count charge of fraud having admitted ownership of over $9.8 million cash found in a house that also belongs to him in Kaduna State.
