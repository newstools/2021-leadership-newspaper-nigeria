The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) said it has trained 5,000 officers of the corps in the north eastern part of the country on security, especially on the use of communication equipment to end insecurity. Commandant General of NSCDC, Dr Abubakar Audi, who disclosed this during a briefing in Abuja on Friday, said the training, which took place from June 11 to 13, 2021 in Maiduguri, Borno State, was in collaboration with the North East Development Commission (NEDC). Audi, who spoke through the deputy commandant general (administration), Zakari Ibrahim Ningi, noted that officers and men of the corps, in the course of their duties in the North-East, face many risks, which often results in loss of lives. He explained that the NSCDC decided to strategise, train and empower the officers of the corps, to boost their morale for effective delivery, in protecting critical infrastructure, which is the core mandate of the corps. The Commandant General added that the NEDC has promised to procure bullet proof vests, ballistic helmets and to construct observation posts, equipped with telecommunication equipment, across the strategic areas in Borno State. Also speaking, a deputy commandant general of the corps, Sani Kazim, said the training was a hybrid programme comprising, not only the training but also acquisition of communication equipment for officers and men serving in the six states of North-East. Kazim said the training also covered information and intelligence gathering, adding that the workshop, which started in the North-East, would cut across the entire the country, for officers and men of the corps.
