Also speaking, the chairman of the JCNC, Hector Nnadi called for the setting-up of the National Council on Civil Aviation. According to him, “the unions wish to passionately reiterate the compelling need for the setting-up of the National Council on Civil Aviation. “This has been the platform for most ministries to examine, explore, initiate, proffer and compare notes on key policy decisions or issues.” Also speaking on the impact of COVID-19 on the industry, the chairman of JCNC said: “the rampaging pandemic generally termed COVID-19 has become not only reference point but also a major turning point in the annals of human history. The quantum of havoc wrecked by this phenomenal viral explosion in the world over cannot be over-emphasised. This challenge has, therefore, been the major and most important topic of discussion among experts, professionals, the academia and even the ordinary artisan on the streets.
