After explaining he asked Mr Taiwo to handcuff me and then told me to produce the gun I used in robbing the owners of the car. “He handcuffed and beat me to the extent that my bone dislocated.

Instead, he said he will beat me till blood comes out from me and later he threw me and my mechanic, Mr Gbenga in the cell. “I have receipts, photocopies particulars of the car and photocopies of the bank transfer I did for the purchase of the car.
