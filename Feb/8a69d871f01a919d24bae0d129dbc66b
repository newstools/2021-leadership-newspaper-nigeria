By Bernard Tolani Dada  | Over 47,000 applicants have applied to be considered for employment as teachers in public secondary schools across the 31 local government areas of Akwa Ibom State. This was in response to the directive by Governor Udom Emmanuel to the State Secondary Education Board (SSEB) to employ no fewer than 1000 graduate teachers in public secondary schools across the LGAs in a bid to reduce the current unemployment situation in the state. A statement on the board’s official Facebook page, however, revealed the SSEB application portal which officially closed on Monday had over 47,000 registered applicants to be considered for the teaching job restricted only for Arts and related subjects excluding the sciences. “With over 47,000 submissions successful, the portal of the SSEB’s 1000 teachers’ recruitment exercise has been closed. Congratulations to those applicants that have expressed their interests in working with us,” the statement said. It urged applicants to regularly check their emails for further information and interview for shortlisted applicants which holds later this month across schools in the three senatorial districts of Uyo, Ikot Ekpene and Eket. A source at SSEB, who does not want his name in print, dismissed the upcoming interview as “a mere hoax”. “Almost 75 per cent of the earmarked 1,000 teachers had been allocated to politicians, traditional rulers and friends of government. “The slots had since been allocated and shared to political cronies, elders, chiefs and other friends of government. Only very few remaining spaces have been reserved for first class graduates to get the job on merit,” the source maintained. However, the SSEB chairman, Mrs Ekaette Ebong Okon, countered the allegation, saying the recruitment process would be followed to the latter in the appointment of the 1000 teachers, assuring no slot would be shared or sold to the highest bidder.
