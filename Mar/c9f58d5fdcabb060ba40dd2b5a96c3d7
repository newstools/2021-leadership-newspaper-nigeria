Tokyo 2020 organising committee CEO Toshiro Muto affirmed yesterday that the postponed Olympics would never be pushed back again or canceled. This was in spite of the fact that the COVID-19 state of emergency covering the Tokyo metropolitan area has been extended by two weeks. Muto told Japan’s Kyodo news agency: “There are people who say the games should be postponed, but from my view, pushing them back is impossible. “Holding them in July is the latest option.” He said athletes would not be able to train under pressure if the games were pushed back to 2022 and the international community would not stand behind this idea. Muto added that the organisers cannot secure the athletes’ village for another year as residents are scheduled to start moving into new condos there in March 2024. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics have been rescheduled for July 23 to Aug. 8.
