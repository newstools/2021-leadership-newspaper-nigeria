Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, presidential campaign posters of the Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, have surfaced on Abuja streets and sections of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Wednesday morning. The poster which reads “2023 For President: Yahaya Bello For A Generational Change,” was sighted by our reporter on the streets around the Ministry of Justice, the Federal Secretariat, NICON Hilton, and Sheraton Hotel at Zone 4. They were also seen on the streets leading to the All Progressives Congress (APC) national secretariat; National University Commission (NUC) office in Wuse 2; the Maitama RoundAbout; as well as at Garki 2. The poster was sponsored by Nigeria Youth Awareness Group (NYAG) YAB 2023. Although the governor was yet to declare his intention to contest for the office of the president, his presidential posters have also appeared in other cities early this year including Kano, Bauchi, Damaturu in Yobe State.  Bello’s poster is the latest in a series of presidential campaign posters that have emerged in recent weeks in Abuja. Other 2023 presidential hopefuls whose campaign posters have adorned the streets of Abuja are APC national leader, Bola Tinubu; former Senate President, Abubakar Bukola Saraki. A campaign poster of former vice president Atiku Abubakar and former Central Bank governor, Chukwuma Soludo on a joint ticket also emerged. This is in spite of the fact that Atiku belongs to PDP while Soludo is a top contender for the forthcoming Anambra State governorship election under the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).
