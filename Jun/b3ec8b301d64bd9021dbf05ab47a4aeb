A former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has distanced himself from 2023 presidential campaign posters which surfaced in Abuja over the weekend. Atiku said he is more occupied with joining hands with other well-meaning Nigerians to help in finding solutions to the security and economic challenges facing the nation. Campaign posters of Atiku and Prof Charles Soludo, an aspirant in the Anambra State governorship election emerged in parts of Abuja. Reacting however, Atiku in a statement by his media aide, Paul Ibe, said he knows nothing about the posters or those who may have promoted it, just as he described it as mischievous. He said “It is obvious that this is a work of mischief. For the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar is of the PDP while Charles Soludo is of APGA. It is silly of anyone to attempt to drag the former Vice President into an election in Anambra which outcome will be determined by the people of the state. “Atiku Abubakar is presently preoccupied with joining hands with other well-meaning Nigerians to help in finding solutions to the myriad of challenges plaguing our nation such as insecurity and economic downturn marked by joblessness and extreme poverty.”
