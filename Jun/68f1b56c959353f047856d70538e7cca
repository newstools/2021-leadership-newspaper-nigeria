House of Representatives has threatened to issue a warrant of arrest against the inspector-general of police (IGP), Usman Baba, the director-general of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) Bashir Jamoh and the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Godwin Emefiele if they failed to honour its summons within 72 hours. The House Ad-hoc Committee investigating the assessment and status of all recovered loots, movable and immovable assets from 2002 to 2020, yesterday decried the flagrant disregard to the parliament by heads or agencies, noting that relevant sections of the laws will be invoked against erring persons. Its chairman, Hon. Adejoro Adeogun, expressed disappointment over the non-appearance of heads of various invited agencies of government. He sought to know how many of the agencies were present but to his dismay, all the aforementioned agencies sent representatives without a formal or official communication to the committee which infuriated the chairman.
“You are indirectly undermining the entire parliament, not just the House of Representatives but the entire institution,” Adeogun said. He also accused the representatives of the agencies of impersonating the agencies as they could not tender any formal letter of introduction from their principals to represent them accordingly. Adeogun said: “You said you are representing CBN, do you have a letter to that effect; if not then you are impersonating. You are a government official, aren’t you? Is that the procedure, that someone just walks into an event and says he is representing you without a formal letter of introduction because as far as we are concerned, you are an imposter? I will therefore yield the floor to my colleagues in case they have anything to say.”
