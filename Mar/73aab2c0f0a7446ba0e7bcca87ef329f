BY HEMBADOON ORSAR MAKURDI Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has commended President Muhammadu Buhari over his directive to security agents to shoot at anyone illegally bearing AK47 rifle. The Governor who gave the commendation when the Chairman Governing Board, Universal Basic Education Commission, UBEC, Professor Adamu Kyuka paid him a courtesy call stated that the President’s order would reduce the level of criminality, banditary and militia herders’ attacks on Benue communities as well as other parts of the country. According to the Governor, “the order would also make the communities safer for displaced farmers to return to their ancestral homes” “I wish to commend Mr. President for his recent order against those bearing AK47 rifles. This I am sure will reduce the high rate of criminality, banditary and militia herdsmen attacks on our farming communities,” the Governor stated. He noted that President Buhari had done the right thing by listening to the calls he and other concerned Nigerians made on the need for the Federal Government to act faster and decisively to save the country from degenerating to a state of anarchy. “I don’t only criticise, I also commend where necessary. And I want to say shame on those psychopaths who were bashing me for writing to Mr. President because he has finally heeded my advice,” the Governor noted. Governor Ortom said Nigeria belongs to all its citizens and only justice and equity anchored on the rule of law could guarantee the unity and stability of the country.
