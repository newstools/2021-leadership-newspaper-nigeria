By Jonathan Nda-Isaiah Igbo indigenes living in Abuja under the aegis of Igbo Brotherhood Community in Abuja, have lauded the prompt release of Senator Rochas Okorocha by the Economic and Financials Crimes Commission (EFCC). The former Imo governor was arrested by the anti-graft agency but was granted bail 48 hours after. In a statement signed by its spokesperson, Chief Chiadikaobi Uwaoma, the group, said they have implicit confidence that Okorocha will be exonerated eventually. According to the spokesman: “we express our heartfelt joy at the prompt release of one of Igbo’s foremost political leaders by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. His speedy release justifies our confidence that Owelle Rochas Okorocha is a responsible and trustworthy leader whose words can be taken to the bank without questioning.” The group further expressed confidence in Okorocha’s innocence of whatever allegations for which he is being investigated. “We do not have the details of accusations against him, but we can say very confidently that the former governor will be exonerated at the end of the day, as long the issues border on corrupt practices and abuse of office. We believe that he is above board on those areas.” “We are all living witnesses to his transformative legacies in the eight years he held sway as governor. We believe that he used Imo money to work for Imo people and his records in the areas of free education, political and economic empowerment of youths of Imo and the Southeast and infrastructural revolution are unrivaled. “Members of the Igbo Brotherhood Community in Abuja are determined to advance the interests of the Igbo nation and give needed support towards the actualization of the collective agenda of Igbo political emancipation,” he added.
