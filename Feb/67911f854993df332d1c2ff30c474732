It is usually celebrated worldwide with groups coming together to recognise and celebrate women’s achievements and their resilience. Excited about the event, the managing director/CEO of the bank, Tony Okpanachi, stated that “Women have proven over the years how  resourceful and dependable they can be, and in some cases have paid the ultimate price for the good of others. For us at DBN, International Women Day is an important one as it allows us to acknowledge, celebrate our females as well as remember our fallen heroines, in the likes of great personalities like Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh, Prof Dora Akunyili, Tolulope Arotile, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti to mention a few, who have been inspirational, not just to women but  to the world at large. Therefore, we at the DBN Plc, believe in the  importance of creating an ecosystem with gender parity where everyone  has an equal opportunity to prove his/her role and contribute to societal development.”
