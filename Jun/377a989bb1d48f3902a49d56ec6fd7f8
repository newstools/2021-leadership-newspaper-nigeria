Nigeria’s equities market is expected to remain positive this week as investors position in interim dividend-paying stocks. An interim dividend is the distribution of earnings to shareholders before the end of the fiscal year. Such dividends are typically paid out monthly or quarterly and in smaller amounts than an annual dividend. On the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited, an interim dividend is paid at the end of the half year. In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected the equities market to trade positively as investors position in stocks of companies, which are expected to pay interim dividends and which have good fundamentals. Also, we have seen the stop rates at the money market remain relatively flat; further moderation in that space may trigger buy sentiment in equities market. Cordros Capital Limited said: “this week, we expect investors to continue cherry-picking stocks ahead of the H1, 2021 dividend declarations. With the recent development in the fixed income (FI) market, we are approaching an inflexion point; we, therefore, see scope for increased buying interest from risk-averse investors. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “in the coming week, we expect to see profit-taking in early trades. However, we believe this will be short-lived before the end of the week on account of bargain hunting by investors.” The chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: the profit-taking may slow down on buying momentum and sustained positioning in good fundamental stocks. According to Omordion, the high buying pressure and inflow of funds into the equity space shows institutional investors or smart money are taking position ahead of economic data and half year earnings reporting season that are around the corner. This, he stressed, suggest that, discerning investors and traders should look the way of sectors and companies with high consumption and demand, capable of impacting positively on company numbers, while hedging against the nation’s galloping inflation. He also urged investors to target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities ahead of interim dividend announcement, saying that this is especially given that despite the seeming improvements, fixed income yield continues to offer negative real rate of return due to the galloping inflation. “However, the strong and faster recovery may continue, depending on market forces, going forward, as propelled by expected second quarter (Q2) earnings reports, until the next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in July,” he said. Last week, sentiment was broadly positive as bullish trading dominated the market. Notably, bargain hunting on blue- chip stocks such as SEPLAT Petroleum Development Company (SEPLAT), Dangote Cement and Zenith Bank buoyed market performance.
