Executive secretary of the Nigeria Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC) Rev. Yakubu Pam has insisted that no pilgrim would be allowed to go on Christian Pilgrimage without clearance from NCPC. The NCPC boss stated this during a courtesy visit by the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria (CTPAN) in Abuja yesterday. He said taking pilgrims out of the country without NCPC is illegal and against the Act that established the commission. “It is illegal for people to travel out of the country on pilgrimage without due respect to NCPC proceedings”, he said, warning “that henceforth the act will not be accepted by the commission.” Pam said many Christian Pilgrimage Operators (CPOs) especially through the Lagos Airport have been taking people on pilgrimage without proper licensing and clearance from the commission and warned that his administration would ensure that those caught in the act would be brought to book. “I have come on board to make sure that there is discipline and to ensure that there is no corruption,” Pam said.
