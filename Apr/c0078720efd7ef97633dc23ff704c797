I  put a call through to my boss…. ‘ Sir  I am afraid I need to see my doctor, I don’t feel too well this morning”. “ Fine. Go see your doctor immediately and let me know how you feel later”. And so I powered off my computer and with Musty off we went to the hospital. Getting to the hospital, a private facility I had registered with about 6 years ago, I couldn’t wait for my vital signs to be taken as I demanded to see  Dr IK immediately! By now I was feeling dizzy….Dr IK is a thorough bred professional in the medical field with over 30 years experience. “  Hajiya what is the problem?” “ Doctor I don’t know but i feel as if there is a war going on in my tummy”. “ Ok let me examine you.” With the speed of light I hopped on the examination bed. A few seconds later he said: “ Your stomach is so agitated….there’s a lot of rumbling in there. What meal did you eat last”? And the story  started. I explained from genesis to revelation the journey of samvita and okro and stew. He queried further. “ Was the food very spicy because from what I can observe it looks like your last meal may have triggered ulcer”. Well we need to run some tests to be sure. But in  the meantime I need to stabilise you until your test results are out”.
