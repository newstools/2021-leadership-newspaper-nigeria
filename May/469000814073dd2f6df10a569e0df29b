The Nigerian Navy (NN) in collaboration with Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center (KAIPTC) and Danish Government, has organised a maritime security training themed ‘Developing Maritime Security Culture in the Gulf of Guinea’ in Lagos. The training programme, which had many participants from various security sectors accross the country including Nigerian Navy, Police, NAPTIP, EFCC and others, was organised in an effort for collective synergy to curb criminality in the Gulf of Guinea. Speaking at the event, Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Western Naval Command, Rear Admiral Barabutemegha Gbassa, said that safeguarding maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea is a shared responsibility between national, regional and international maritime players. He said that, this and many other factors formed the nucleus of discussion of a course tittled ‘Developing Maritime Security Culture in the Gulf of Guinea’, adding that the programme was for key players in Nigerian Maritime Law Enforcement Agencies. He noted that lack of awareness of the importance of the sea means that it can be an uphill struggle to gain political attention or resources for revising maritime security policies and capacity building. He stated that the related question of maritime culture takes a crucial dimension when the role values and beliefs play in decision making is factored in. Gbassa, who was respresented by the Chief of Staff, Nigerian Naval Training Command (NAVTRAC), Rear Admiral Monday Unurhiere, said that failure to give attention to the impact of culture in any maritime security policy or strategy could jeopardise the effectiveness of that strategy. “In the light of this that I am excited about the potentials of this capacity building effort to draw attention to the seemingly innocuous but crucial role of cultural considerations to maritime security governance,” he added.
