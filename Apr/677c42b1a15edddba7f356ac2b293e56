By Jonathan Nda-Isaiah  The Olubadan of Ibadan land, HRM Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji (Aje Ogungunniso I) and the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII), will on Saturday honour foremost philanthropist and former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, with ‘The Outstanding Friend of Ibadanland’ Award.  According to the letter of notification, the award was in recognition of the former governor’s contribution to the education of indigent children through his free education programme and establishment of tuition-free schools –  Rochas Foundation Colleges in Ibadan, Oyo State.  25,000 indigent children, out of which 6,000 are from Oyo state and other South-West states have benefitted from Okorocha’s free education programme.  In a statement issued on behalf of the Olubadan of Ibadanland, the award will cap the grand finale of the 2021 Ibadan Cultural Festival Celebrations at the Liberty Stadium.  The statement reads: “We in Ibadan have decided to celebrate you now and outside your territory so as to show you that Ibadan has created a deserved permanent place for you in her territory. You are most deserving of this honour by virtue of your establishment of Rochas Foundation College first at Oke Ado Ibadan and very recently at the Toll Gate, Ibadan/Lagos Expressway.  “This unique youth empowerment legacy of yours will remain indelible in our minds till eternity. It is also a testimony to the fact that you have what it takes to reposition our great country.”  It will be recalled that over 20 years ago, Okorocha, who is also the Senator representing Imo West, established the Rochas Foundation Colleges in Sokoto, Zaria, Yola, Bauchi, Kano, Ibadan, Calabar, Enugu, Owerri and Ogboko in Imo state.  The colleges provide free education for indigent children. The gesture was expanded to 55 African countries where indigent children are randomly selected and given free education up to university level.
