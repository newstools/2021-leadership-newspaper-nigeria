EESA is partnering with MHG to stage the event. He said Nigeria was able to secure the hosting rights in spite of fierce lobbying by countries like Vietnam, Russia and others who saw the economic potentials in hosting such a large event. “This event is a 10-day event starting from September 30, 2021 when the Economic Summit will take place, then meetings with ambassadors of participating countries which would culminate in the coronation of the winner on the last day,” Mantu said. Mantu also said the event will exhibit different African heritage and multi-diverse cultures from across the world. “We have invited world renowned speakers and successful entrepreneurs and living legends as well as students of business to participate in this African festivity,” he added. Also, the president, Miss Heritage Global, Mr Nhlanhla Shabangu, said the event would showcase the tangible and intangible heritage of the continent.
