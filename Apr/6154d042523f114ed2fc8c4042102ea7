By Francis Okoye, Maiduguri No fewer than seven suspected Boko Haram terrorists were on Friday reportedly killed when Nigerian troops, comprising soldiers and police operatives repelled attack on a convoy of the Borno State Government officials, along Mongunob- Nganzai Road.  The top government officials in the convoy, our correspondent gathered, included Borno State Attorney General, Kakashehu Lawal;  Commissioner of Rehabilitation Reconstruction and Resettlement, Mustapha Gubio, and that of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Alhaji Mai-Mele. A security source revealed that the government officials were returning from Monguno, where they went to distribute relief materials to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), when their convoy came under heavy attack by the terrorists, who rode on several guntrucks.  The source said that a security team headed by Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) Muhammed Ibrahim, as well as a team of soldiers, swiftly engaged the terrorists in a fierce gun battle, which lasted for about 15 minutes.  It was gathered that seven insurgents were instantly gunned down while one was arrested.  The source added that three soldiers were injured during the encounter, but were quickly evacuated to a hospital in Maimalari Cantonment Military Hospital for treatment of bullet wounds.  “The gallant troops furiously engaged the terrorists with superior fire power, eliminating at least seven of them whose bodies have been recovered, while several others escaped with bullet wounds.  “Unfortunately, three soldiers were wounded during the gun battle, and were evacuated to the hospital in Maimalari Cantonment,” the source explained.
