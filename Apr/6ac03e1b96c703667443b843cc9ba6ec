Former minister of youth and sports development, Solomon Dalung, says Nigeria can host the African Games with the current facilities in Benin. Dalung, who said this on the sidelines of the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival (NSF) which climaxed yesterday in Benin, said he was proud of the Edo State government in providing the facilities. “First of all, I commend Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo for delivering on his promise of a successful festival, while I challenge other states to provide the same facilities for their people. “Second, I’m very proud of what I see here in Edo. The facilities here can be used to host any international event. “With the way I see this infrastructure, I’m tempted to think that we no longer have challenges of bidding for any international competition. We can successfully host the African Games in Nigeria with an infrastructure like this. “I want to challenge other state governments to follow suit and put up good facilities, an infrastructure like these at least in every state capital,” he said.
Dalung disclosed that he was in Benin on the personal invitation of Gov. Obaseki to witness the closing ceremony of the festival.
