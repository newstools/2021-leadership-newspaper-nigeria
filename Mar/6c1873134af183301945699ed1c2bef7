According to the Agwatyap, he and members of his traditional council are working to clarify and resolve the circumstances of the disappearance of three community leaders. The statement recalled that Ardo Pate Usman Kurmi (Wakilin Fulani Atyap), Ardo Muhammadu Anchau and Yakubu Muhammadu have been missing since joining a team of community leaders to resolve a dispute involving a farmer whose crops were destroyed by cattle. The governor commended the Agwatyap ‘’for his courage in the push for peace across the communities in his chiefdom and assured him that the state government and the security agencies will continue to support the quest for peace and security,’’ he added. The special adviser said that the  governor expressed dismay ‘’ by the resurgence of attacks that have resulted in the loss of lives and property, but told  the Agwatyap that troops of Operation Safe Haven and other security agencies are working to contain the recent upsurge. ‘’ El-Rufai appealed to community leaders to remain steadfast in maintaining the constituency for peace and expose those who prefer the continuation of the tragic cycle of attacks and reprisals.
