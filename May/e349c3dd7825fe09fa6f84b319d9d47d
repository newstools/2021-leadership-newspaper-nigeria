Great Nigeria Insurance (GNI) has grown its annuity portfolio to over N4.7billion in first quarter 2021,  indicating, a percentage increase of 8,876.05 per cent over the sum of N52.5million recorded during the same period in 2020. Speaking on this development at the company’s head office in Ikoyi, Lagos, the corporate communications and brand manager, GNI, Oyinkansola Sobande, pointed out that retirement should be the time to live stress-free life after years of active engagement and not a time of financial difficulties. Annuity, she said, sets out to protect the future of retirees through guaranteed income for as long as they live. Oyinkansola further elucidated that Annuity for Life policy is a retirement instrument option for retiring employees. “It is a contract that provides, in return for a lump sum, a monthly or quarterly payment starting immediately after retirement and continuing for the rest of the retiree’s life. The contract is often purchased by retiring persons who want an income that is guaranteed to last for the rest of their life, no matter how long that might be,” she said. On her part, the managing director/chief executive officer, Mrs Cecilia O. Osipitan, explained that life annuity is a stream of periodic payments that commence at a specified date, which is either the normal retirement age or at 50 in the case of early retirement. This payment, she said, could either be monthly or quarterly depending on the retiree’s preference. According to her, the benefits include the continuous flow of regular income for the retiree, insulation from the risks associated with the investment of lump sum benefits, structured management of resources and the transference of the risk of diminution in assets and possible failure of investments of retirees to insurance companies which are better equipped to manage such risks.
