The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria. PDP said the revelations available to it show how APC leaders at one of their party’s national caucus meetings recommended the regulation of social media in Nigeria and how they have been plotting to obliterate internet-based interaction platforms such as Twitter. The national publicity secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, recalled how the APC Caucus has been pushing bills in the National Assembly, particularly in November 2020, seeking to enforce a draconian regulation of social media so as to gag Nigerians from exposing its atrocities, including human right abuses, treasury looting, nepotism and sectional marginalisation by the APC administration. Ologbondiyan said, “Nigerians can also recall how the APC administration in carrying out the agenda of its party have been using the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, to suffocate the media space with humongous fines and threats of suspension of operating license on broadcast stations. “The PDP wants the APC to know that their plot against Nigerians has been exposed and cannot stand. “Our nation is known for her resilient citizenry and no leader or political party has been able to suppress the wishes of Nigerians. “The APC, in spite of its machinations, cannot vanquish Nigerians in their determination for a free and democratic nation where sovereignty belongs to the people,” the party added.
