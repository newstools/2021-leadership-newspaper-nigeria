The market gain was driven by price appreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; Airtel Africa, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Lafarge Africa, Julius Berger and Fidson Healthcare. Cordros Capital Limited said that “Pre-MPC meeting, we observed that the upward repricing of yields on long-dated bonds triggered reduced appetite for equities among domestic institutional investors. With the MPC maintaining the ‘lower-for-longer’ theme for rates, we expect a positive reaction in the equities market. “Accordingly, we expect risk-averse investors to recalibrate their portfolio towards fundamentally sound stocks with attractive dividend yields. With the eagerly anticipated MPC meeting out of the way, we now expect investors’ attention to be focused on bond auction results as they seek clues on the direction of yields in the forex market.” Market sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was positive, as 35 stocks gained, relative to 21 losers.
