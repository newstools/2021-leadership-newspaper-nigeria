BY HUSSAINI JIRGI, Damaturu The Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, has called on the military to urgently do something to stop the continued incursion into Yobe State by Boko Haram/Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP). Buni made this call on Sunday during a meeting with the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor. The governor had visited the CDS to discuss the last Friday’s attacks on Geidam town by terrorists, a situation that has put the residents on the edge. According to a press statement on Sunday by the director general, Press Affairs and Media to the governor, Mallam Mamman Mohammed, he said Governor Buni had since Friday been liaising with the security agencies to find a lasting solution to the incessant attacks on Geidam and the border communities. He told the CDS that there was the urgent need to find a permanent solution to the intrusion of the insurgents into the state. He noted that “the problem we have is the movement of the insurgents from the fringes of Lake Chad into the state.”
He said, “We need to check this holistically to proffer permanent solution to the menace.” The governor said that the people of Geidam had been subjected to several attacks and untold hardships that must be checked. “As a leader, l have to explore all avenues including meeting the Chief of Defence Staff and the service chiefs to ensure the safety and security of the people of Geidam and the state at large,” he added.
