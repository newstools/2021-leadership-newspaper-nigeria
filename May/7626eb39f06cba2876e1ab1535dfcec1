By Abubakar Yunusa Abuja Barrister Paul Edeh, proprietor and financier of one of the frontline Women Football Teams in Nigeria, Ratel FC, has reaffirmed his commitment to women football development in the country. He gave the assurance while speaking to journalists in Abuja yesterday, saying adding values to the most vulnerable and neglected children in the society is a big drive for him. “Having decided that I’m going to invest in football, every iota of penny would be invested in them. If the girls are hungry, it means I’m hungry and if their salaries are not paid, it also means, I do not have money or don’t have a dime at my disposal. “I have three daughters, and the last of them is eight-year-old old. That speaks to how much love I have for girls-child football,” he said. He commended the leadership of Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) for putting together a successful Super 6 tournament and urged them to strive toward improving the officiating. “It was a well organised tournament and we are looking forward to a better tournament next year by correcting some of the lapses notice during the championship,” he added.
