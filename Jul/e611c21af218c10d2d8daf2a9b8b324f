Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has demolished over 137 illegal blocks of hostels, motels, and other structures at Iddo Sarki, a community next to the University of Abuja’s main campus. A combined team of the FCT ministerial committee on City Sanitation, the Department of Development Control, the Department of Security Services, and other relevant agencies carried out the exercise yesterday, under the directive of the FCT minister, Mohammad Bello, to remove all contraventions and illegality from the nation’s capital. The chairman of the Ministerial Committee on City Sanitation, Comrade Ikharo Attah, said the FCT Minister was enraged by people’s repeated disregard for warnings to stay away from local chiefs who have no authority to sell lands or transfer any valid title to buyers of such land, according to the provisions of the Land Use Act. Attah said that the exercise was a fast intervention to avoid further distorting the city’s growth plans and to save desperate businessmen and women from financial ruin.
