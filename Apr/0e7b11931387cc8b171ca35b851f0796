In continuation of his commitment to tackling youth unemployment, create jobs and harness the vast potentials of youths towards productive activities, Governor Muhammadu Yahya has directed the commencement of registration of holders of National Certificate of Education (NCE) and National Diploma. According to the state government, like the Graduate Unemployment registration which commenced few months earlier, the aim of this exercise is to generate accurate data on the extent, nature, patterns and spread of youth unemployment in the state.
