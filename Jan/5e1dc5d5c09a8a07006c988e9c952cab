West Bromwich Albion manager Sam Allardyce has confirmed his interest in signing Nigeria’s Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa. Musa is a free agent after leaving Saudi outfit Al-Nassr and the Baggies will run the rule over the forward before making a decision on whether to offer him a short-term deal. “We’ve had many other players on the radar, many abroad, but we’ve not been able to secure that particular player yet,”Allardyce told a news conference yesterday. “He’s not here yet, so until he turns up. “He’s a person of interest and when he arrives we’ll alert everybody and let them know.” Musa’s previous stint in the Premier League with Leicester City ended on a sour note as he made seven league starts in 21 outings.
