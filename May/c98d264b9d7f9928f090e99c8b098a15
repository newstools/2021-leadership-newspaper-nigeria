By Jonathan Nda- Isaiah | Secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, has said his attention had been drawn to false information circulating on the social media through emails, text messages and other outlets urging members of the public to submit their curriculum vitae at a fee to a non-existing desk in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (OSGF) to facilitate their selection for federal government appointments. In a statement issued by his media office, the SGF also observed with dismay that the fraudsters had become so desperate to the extent that they resort to sending fake advertisements for supply of some medical diagnostic equipment to his office. Mustapha said: “The public is by this notice advised to disregard such information as the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation has no such mandate and has never requested for such information nor does it advertises for the procurement of medical diagnostic equipment of any sort. “In view of the above, the SGF warns the originators of such fraudulent requests to desist forthwith from using his office to fleece unsuspecting members of the public or face the wrath of the law,” the statement said.
