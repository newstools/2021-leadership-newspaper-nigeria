The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Dr Yerima Tarfa, has assured that the federal government was determined to reduce the level of irregular migration from the country. Tarfa gave the assurance in Lagos when he attended the Steering Committee meeting of GIZ Nigeria’s programme on migration for development held within the week.  The event was also used to officially commission the Nigerian-German Centre for Jobs, Migration and Re-integration Building, which will provide vocational and entrepreneurship training to returnees and the local populace. He said the occasion was important because it afforded stakeholders the opportunity “To reflect and refresh minds on where we are and where we want to be in the battle against irregular migration.”  Tarfa stressed that the federal government alone cannot provide all the jobs needed by Nigerian youths, especially against the backdrop of the unemployment statistics released recently by Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS). In his remarks, the Consul General of the German Consulate in Nigeria, Dr. Stefan Traumann, congratulated the PME Team Lead on the Centre’s launch as he was present when the stone was laid for the building in 2019.  He noted that the Nigerian youth are an asset and future of the country, hence their development must be invested heavily, promising that the German government will continue to support the efforts of the Nigerian government to achieve this in a bid to reduce the scourge of irregular migration. The commissioning of the Centre also featured an exhibition of the products made by previous beneficiaries of training programmes.
