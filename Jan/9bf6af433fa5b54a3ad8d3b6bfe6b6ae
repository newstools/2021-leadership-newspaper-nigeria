A Convocation Lecture delivered at the Shehu Shagari College of Education Sokoto on 27th December 2020 to commemorate the (50 Years) Golden Jubilee and 22nd Convocation Ceremony.       By:   The Chief Servant Muazu Babangida Aliyu, PhD, OON, CON Talban Minna/ Sardaunan Hausa Former Governor of Niger State.  At the Beginning.   Those roles exposed me to many challenges which sharpened my leadership skills and made me more sensitive and concerned with human sufferings, desires, needs and potentialities. My stay here instilled in me the love of humanity regardless of race, background, ethnicity or religious beliefs. It brought to the fore, my innate tendency and desire to assist whenever and wherever desirable. Indeed, I could say that was when I realized the meaning of ‘all round development in education.’ We were also lucky that during our time NCE holders served the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in 1977, I was posted to Lagos state where I taught in a Secondary School. By 1978 the Labour Unions were re-organized and formed the Nigeria Labour Congress. I had the opportunity to be close to the Leadership of NLC and I got all I wanted and went back to Niger State to resuscitate the Nigeria Union of Teachers. We brought the other Unions under the umbrella of Nigeria Labour Congress, where I became the first Secretary and later the Chairman of Niger State NLC.   NEW CHALLENGES BESETTING EDUCATION      The total budget is N13.5 trillion; Deficit built into the budget is N5.196 trillion; and So, when you add the deficit to the debt servicing, you have N8.516 trillion. You deduct N8.516 trillion from N13.5 trillion, you are left with only N4.984 trillion to service all the Federal Government’s commitments including re-current and capital services. Little wonder, therefore, that Nigeria cannot go beyond 10% allocation for education not to mention the 26% budgetary allocation recommended by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)    ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLEGES OF EDUCATION.        SHEHU SHAGARI COLLEGE OF EDUCATION    Ten thousand (10,000) are regular students .One thousand, six hundred and five students are undergraduates; and The totality of students attend some thirty-eight (38) subject departments and the directorate of Undergraduate studies. A simple arithmetic may show ratio 1:23 staff to students. This does not take into consideration the Department of Education and General Studies. It could be argued that if a college of Education could go into agreement with Universities to produce graduates, then why not give the Colleges of Education the right to award degrees subject to proper accreditations? This will complement the efforts of National Teachers Institute (NTI) and our various Universities.    CONCLUDING REMARKS   . We pray to have Federal and State government in 2023 or beyond that may declare emergency on education for a specified period of time to ensure no child is left out of the classroom. The free education should be from primary to senior secondary school. . Teaching must be properly and adequately professionalized to attract the right people with an attractive and differently salary scale;  Thank you.
