The chief nutrition officer in the state, Hajiya Halima Yusuf, disclosed this yesterday in Lafia during a high level advocacy dialogue on nutrition in the state.

She said out of the number of children admitted in various healthcare centres across the state, 81 of them died while over 2000 had recovered. Nasarawa State chairman, Committee on Food and Nutrition, Alhaji Osama Abdul who is also the director, planning in the state Ministry of Finance, said as part of efforts to tackle malnutrition, the multi sectoral action plan with financial implications of over N3 billion had been developed for approval by the state governor. The executive secretary, Civil Society-Scaling up Nutrition in Nigeria (CS- SUNN), Mrs Beatrice Eluaka, described the level of malnutrition in the state as alarming. She stressed the need for the state government to adopt local solution to address the trend rather than depending on foreign assistance.
