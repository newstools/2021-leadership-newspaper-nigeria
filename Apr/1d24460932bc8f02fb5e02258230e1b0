Interviewed by Henry Tyohemba VANESSA IDOKO loves the fact that she can unwind and take things nice and easy.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-286775" src="https://i1.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/frfr.png?resize=389%2C493&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="389" height="493" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Typical Friday mood will be …. lie on my bed and watch some movies or better still hang out with friends. Friday lunch would be…hot spaghetti and fish because it’s one of my soul food’s greatest culinary combinations. The music playlist…Bounce by Rema on repeat because it gives me that groovy feeling. Three hang out buddies… Kayla and Khole for their vibes.

Ejike <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-286777" src="https://i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shykra.png?resize=384%2C469&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="384" height="469" data-recalc-dims="1" /> KNOW GOD FOR YOURSELF I have   come   to   learn   that I have to know God    for    myself.    This    involves    an    intimate    relationship   with   God   that helps one in life. Let what the pastor says be   a   confirmation   of   what   God   has   already   told you.  If not, you will be carried away by every doctrine. LOVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY Love is a beautiful thing and as such it needs to be enjoyed. I   have   learnt   to   love   with all my heart.  That way good things come to you. BE PRUDENT We are always faced with difficulties and a lot of financial        challenges.        The   current   economic   situation    is    also    not    helping matters. This calls for prudence and   effective   financial   management. I have learnt to properly manage   my   resources   so as not to be found wanting at any time. FORGIVE Many people have hurt me and I am certain that   I   have   offended   many people too.  The only way to move on happily   is   to   forgive   always. Forgiving            quickly            relieves you of so many burdens. Put family first I   have   also   learnt   to   prioritize family first.  In   the   most   difficult   times, family is always there    for    you.    You    cannot do away with them and you’ll need them at one point or the other. PRAY Notwithstanding your religion or belief, prayer always provides the   key   to   all   doors.   When I am down and out, I   always   resort   to prayers and it does wonders. Always remember to pray for others. DREAM DREAMS I have also come to believe that it is never too late to chase your dreams. Anything is achievable as far as you can dream it.
