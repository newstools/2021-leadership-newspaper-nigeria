The Rivers State government has committed five billion naira to the development of  facilities at the Yenagoa campus of the Nigerian Law School. Governor Nyesom Wike made the disclosure at the flag-off  of construction of two hostel blocks and a 1,500-seat auditorium in the law school on Friday. The governor said he was motivated by the love for his people and education, adding that the projects were aimed at addressing infrastructure deficit in the institution. Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa who applauded Wike at the event for  the gesture, noted that the institution was established in 2011. Diri, represented by his deputy, Mr Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, said the school lacked infrastructure. “These projects ought to be federal government projects. The campus and almost all the facilities you are seeing were provided by the Bayelsa State government. “We want to profusely thank our sister state for joining hands with us to develop this institution. “We are happy for your right hand of cooperation and fellowship even as we call on the Federal Government and  those of us from the South- South to nurture this campus to become a reputable citadel of learning,” he said. Earlier, Mr Abubakar Malami, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, commended Wike for embarking on the project which he said would help to create an enabling environment for teaching and learning. Malami, represented by the Solicitor-General of the Federation, Mr Dayo Akpata, said  existing law school campuses could only accommodate 6,000 of more than 10,000 candidates seeking legal education yearly. He called on other state governors to emulate Wike in providing infrastructure for law schools. (NAN)
