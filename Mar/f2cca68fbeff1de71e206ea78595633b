Speaking on the theme of the event, the convener, Goddie Ofose said that the theme could not have come at the better time as COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the big corporate plans for their corporate social responsibility initiatives. “Last year, organisations Nigeria as well as elsewhere abandoned their CSR plans and kept donating to the government at all levels to fight the pandemic. This singular development caused several companies to halt the CSR activities for the year,” Ofose said.
