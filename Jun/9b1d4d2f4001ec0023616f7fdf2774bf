Nigeria’s Super Eagles technical adviser, Gernot Rohr, has cautioned the home based Eagles’ players against playing for self-glory when they face Mexico in an international friendly game in the United States of America next month. The German gaffer, who spoke to LEADERSHIP Sports during the team’s first training session at the FIFA Goal project, Package B of the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja, yesterday, wants the players to put the interest of the country above their self-seeking personal glory. He further revealed that more players are expected to join the team in camp after Wednesday’s NPFL rescheduled match between Abia Warriors and Eyimba FC, saying exceptional players would be invited to join the main team.

LEADERSHIP reports that the next month’s international friendly match between Nigeria and Mexico will take centre stage at the famous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the State of California, USA on Saturday July 3rd 2021.
