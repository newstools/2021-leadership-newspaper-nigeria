Enyimba will face either Rivers United or Bloemfontein Celtic of South Africa in the playoff round of the CAF Confederation Cup. The Peoples Elephant dropped down to the CAF Confederation Cup following their elimination from the Champions League after a 4-2 aggregate loss to Sudanâ€™s Al Merreikh. Rivers United look good to book a date with Enyimba after edging out Bloemfontein Celtic 2-0 away in the first leg of their first round fixture. The reverse fixture in Port Harcourt was postponed after Nigerian authorities refused to step down on coronavirus protocols for Bloemfontein Celtic.
The playoff round tie will be played between February 14 and 21. The overall winner will proceed to the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup.
