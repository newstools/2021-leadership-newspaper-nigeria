Foremost Islamic preacher, Sheikh Sulaiman Dan-Borno has given Kwara State governor, AbdulRahaman AbdulRazaq, a pass mark in the running of the state affairs in the last two years. The fearless preacher, however, urged AbdulRazaq not to rest on his oars. He said the governor was lucky to have committed and loyal aides, whom he noted have positively complemented the governor’s efforts in delivering his electioneering campaign promises to the generality of the people of the state. Dan-Borno spoke at a special prayer organised by the All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders in Ilorin East local government area of the state to mark the Governor Abdulrasaq administration’s second year anniversary and pray God to make the second term ambition of the governor a reality. For his part, the Chief Imam of Ilorin, Sheikh Mohammed Bashir Salihu, who led the prayer, also described Governor AbdulRazaq as “Omoluabi”, meaning a gentleman. He prayed God to continue to guide the governor aright in all his endeavours. The prayer had in attendance the state’s deputy governor, Mr Kayode Alabi; member representing Ilorin East Constituency in the State House of Assembly, Hon.Ali Jimoh; Special Adviser on Strategy, Alh Sa’adu Salahu; Special Adviser on Religious Matters, Alh Ibrahim Danmaigoro; the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Communications, Hajia Mopelola AbdulRahman, and Ambassador Yahaya Seriki, among others. Speaking on behalf of the organisers of the prayer, Ambassador Yahaya Seriki said: “We organised this prayer in appreciation of the many infrastructure projects that the governor has executed in Ilorin East LGA in the last two years. “In view of Governor AbdulRazaq’s monumental achievements in the last two years, we are urging him to seek re-election in 2023 to enable him continue his good work for the people of the state. We are also asking God to make the re-election of Governor AbdulRazaq possible in 2023; this is the reason why we organised this prayer.”
