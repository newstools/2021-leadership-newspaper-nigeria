Movie title: Nobody Genre: Action, Crime, Drama Top Cast: Bob Odenkirk How long can you pretend to be someone you’re not? Review: Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman of ‘Better call Saul’ and ‘Breaking bad’) plays Hutch Mansell, a man who has tried to leave his violent past behind. It all changed when two thieves break into his home one night. The path eventually leads to a showdown with the Russian mob, thereby awakening the beast within Hutch. Overall, a great watch. I really look forward to a sequel.
