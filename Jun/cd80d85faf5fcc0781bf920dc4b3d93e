The Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHED) yesterday began mass repairs of faulty power lines and other facilities. The PHED’s acting manager, corporate communications, Mrs Chioma Aninwe, made this known in a statement in Port Harcourt. She said: “The intensive fault clearing exercise is being carried out in our franchise area, including Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River and Rivers states. “PHED decided to clear all identifiable faults in its network due to our commitment to keeping the lights on.
“PHED is passionate about delivering on its promise of providing steady electricity to customers in its franchise areas. “We therefore appeal to customers who are experiencing prolonged outages to call PHED’s 24/7 call centre and lodge their complaints or visit any of our nearest offices.” Aninwe urged PHED’s customers to reciprocate the efforts of the company to provide stable electricity by paying their electricity bills when due. According to her, prompt payment of bills by customers will enable the company to meet its statutory obligations and ensure sustainability of service. (NAN)
