First City Monument Bank (FCMB) has expanded its financial support to the renewable energy sector while re-assuring that it would continue to champion, execute and support initiatives that would enhance the ecosystem.
The move, it added, was to tackle some of the adverse effects of climate change and other challenges facing the environment. According to the bank, this is in recognition of the fact that a cleaner and more sustainable environment is key to building a better world for present and future generations. FCMB gave the assurance in a statement to commemorate this year’s World Environment Day (WED), which was held on June 5, 2021, with the theme, ‘Ecosystem Restoration.’ The annual WED is one of the principal vehicles through which the United Nations stimulates worldwide awareness of the environment and climate issues. Through the years, FCMB, under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) philosophy, has maintained active participation in the WED. Speaking on FCMB’s commitment to environmental sustainability and the WED, the group head, corporate affairs, Mr. Diran Olojo, stated that these interventions are part of the bank’s progressive journey and contribution towards making the world a better place. According to him, “in Nigeria, the devastating effects of climate change are being felt through land degradation, deforestation, drought, flood, high temperature, migration, low agricultural output, unemployment among other negative effects. “These limit opportunities for human and business growth, which is why we are committed to playing an active role to address these challenges as one of the major contributors to the development of Nigeria”. He assured that the bank’s business decisions and operations will continue to take into consideration factors that could negatively impact the environment, society and hinder long-term growth prospects.
