A renowned security expert and entrepreneur, Chief Irimiya Ezekiel Afukonyo, has enjoined youths in the country to shun cultism and the unhealthy drive to get rich quickly by all means. Afukonyo made the appeal during the “Inter-tribal Soccer Fiesta” final match between Team Taraba and Team Nasarawa, organised by Comrade Jonathan Hamza held at the Koroduma All Star Football Club, Training Ground, Koroduma, One-Man Village, Karu Local Government Area, Nasarawa State. He said fame and riches are never obtained on a platter of gold or by hallucination. According to him, “To achieve your dreams, you must be focused and dedicated, you must avoid the distractions of the moments to give yourself a bright future. Fame and riches are never obtained on a platter of gold or by hallucination, but via hard work, dedication, and humility.” He noted that sporting activities do not only bring people together, it is also an avenue for youth development. “Sport and football, in particular, has become a money-spinning venture all over the world and with great effort, commitments and dedication, you could change your story for the rest of your lives. “We have seen individuals from humble backgrounds have a breakthrough in football by playing in Europe’s highly celebrated clubs. It however took a great deal of hard work and painstaking efforts for African great players like Kanu Nwankwo, Austin JJ Okocha, Mikel Obi, Samuel Eto’o, George Weah, Didier Drogba amongst others who are currently doing great in soccer.” He added that Nigerian youths are not lazy but are full of energy, and must be helped to direct their energies into a worthwhile and profitable venture like sports to prevent them from dissipating the same into criminal and nefarious activities. The football match was won by Team Taraba in a penalty shoot-out after regulation time.
