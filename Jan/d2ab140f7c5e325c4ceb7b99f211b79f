By Our Correspondent Gombe State government has received the first of five 40 feet containers of lightly used medical equipment and supplies from the United States-based charity organisation, Project CURE. The items delivered include portable Xray machines, digital ultrasound machines, anaesthetic machines, emergency resuscitation beds (ERBs) and ventilators.  Other items are defibrillators, oxygen concentrators, electrocardiogram machines, fetal doppler machines, vascular ultrasound and different types of medical supplies. The items arrived at Gombe on Saturday. The state government had entered into a partnership with the United States-based healthcare service organisation in a bid to improve the health sector for effective and efficient service delivery.  This followed the Governor Inuwa Yahayaâ€™s earlier visit to the head office of the organisation in Phoenix, Arizona shortly after he won the March 9 gubernatorial elections where he sought for support in addressing the dire conditions of the health facilities in the state and the general healthcare challenges.  Project CURE had in September 2019, sent a team led by Charles Irion which toured around the 23 secondary health facilities in Gombe state and carried out a needs assessment of the hospitals.  Sequel to that exercise, the US organisation packaged 5 numbers 40 ft containers full of medical equipment and supplies to help bridge the gaps identified by their assessment team in Gombe State.  Project CURE is an international organisation which partners states in developing countries to offer support to hospitals, clinics and community health centres to help them provide quality healthcare and other critical medical services.
