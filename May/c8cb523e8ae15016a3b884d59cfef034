No fewer than 100 golfers will swing for honours at the Engr Oladapo Olaide Mohammmed and Engr Abdulai Adebayo Francis’ Conferment Kitty teeing off on Saturday, May 22. The Conferment Kitty which is part of activities lined up to celebrate Oladapo and Francis election as fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers would take center stage at the IBB International Golf and Country Club, Abuja. Speaking ahead of the kitty, Oladapo who is the chairman of the FCT Golf Association, said preparations are in top gear to host a successful event in line with COVID-19 protocols. “The kitty is just to bring people to- gether and compete among ourselves in thanking Allah for taking us this far. You know that the COVID-19 pandem- ic have kept most of us away from the golf course,” Oladapo said. According to him, mouthwatering prizes are up for grabs during the one- day event. “We have mouthwatering prizes to be given to the winners in all the categories and also consolation prizes for best endeavors. So, I encourage golf- ers to turn up in their number so we can have a good time where we will also dine and unwind after the kitty.” “Also we are going to observe all the COVID-19 protocols strictly to ensure the safety of all the golfers and officials during the kitty” he concluded.
