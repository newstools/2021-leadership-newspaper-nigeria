Germany has extended its lockdown for three weeks, imposing an almost complete halt over the Easter holiday in response to a third wave of coronavirus infections. After talks with regional leaders, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany was now in a “very serious” situation. Restrictions will be even tougher from 1-5 April, when most shops will be shut and gatherings will be limited. Meanwhile, France’s president wants vaccinations “morning, noon and night”. Emmanuel Macron was responding to an increase in intensive care cases and warnings of an “explosion” in hospital admissions.
