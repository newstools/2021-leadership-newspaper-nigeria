Barcelona defender Gerard Pique has weighed in to a debate about refereeing by saying many officials in Spain were likely to favour his club’s great rivals Real Madrid. Pique, in an interview on YouTube show Post United on Thursday, said that if the vast majority of LaLiga referees supported Real Madrid, they would naturally be partial to that team when refereeing their games. The central defender, recovering from a long-term knee injury, was reacting to Spanish media reporting comments from former referee Eduardo Iturralde Gonzalez that many officials in Spain were Real Madrid fans. ‘The other day a former referee said that 85 per cent of the referees are from Madrid,’ Pique said in the interview.
‘How are they not going to whistle in favour of Madrid? Even unconsciously, how are they not going to give more for one side than the other?
