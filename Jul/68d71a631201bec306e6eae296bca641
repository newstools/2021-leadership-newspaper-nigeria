Italy are champions of Europe after coming from behind in regular-time, as well as the penalty shootout, to beat England in the EURO 2020 final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. Sunday’s triumph marks Italy’s first European triumph since claiming continental superiority in 1968, and their first major trophy since lifting the 2006 World Cup. Luke Shaw opened the scoring before many viewers around the world had even settled in for the start of the game and England looked well on their way to bringing football home, but Italy equalized through Leonardo Bonucci at the midway point of the second half. England went ahead early in the shootout as well, but England failed to convert on three straight attempts — two saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma and one hit off the post — in rounds 3-5.
