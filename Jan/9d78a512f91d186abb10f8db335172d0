She said that in reaction to the news of their relationship, she told her plainly that if things did not work out between them, she would still maintain a working relationship with Eazi. Her words: “Those first weeks we were dating, she [DJ Cuppy] had obviously introduced us and she was there and she was still cultivating a working relationship with you [Mr Eazi]. “And so, she calls me and said ‘so you guys are dating officially and I said, yes, I like him and she said, all I am going to say is that if things don’t work well with you both, I am going to maintain my work relationship with him [Mr Eazi]’ and she was straight up about it.”  Mr Eazi has no choice than to maintain a cool head in that environment.
