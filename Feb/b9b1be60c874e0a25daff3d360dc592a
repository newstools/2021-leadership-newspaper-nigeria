Ijeoma was one of the best in my department (Psychology Dept. 2010/2014) we always teased each other and I would tell her ‘girl you must work in my rehabilitation centre’. “#JusticeForIjeoma. And she will say Mercy this department doesn’t fit you and we will laugh over it, when I heard she was missing we hoped and prayed they find her alive, my heart is bleeding we want justice, justice must be served #JusticeForIjeoma,” she said. The killing of Ijeoma has generated lots of controversies and Nigerians and celebrities alike are pleading for a fruitful investigation and prosecution of culprits.
