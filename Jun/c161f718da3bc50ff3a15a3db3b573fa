Joint Action Committee of the Akwa Ibom State University comprising the Academic Staff Union of University, Non-academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated institutions and National Association of Academic Technologists yesterday defied the threat of “no-work no-pay” issued by the institution’s management. The institution’s vice chancellor, Prof. Nse Essien, had in a release by the registrar, Mr. John Udo, ordered all the striking workers to return to their duty posts yesterday and threatened that their salaries would be paid on “no work, no pay basis.” Governor Udom Emmanuel had during a media briefing ordered the reopening of the institution, saying he had released a monthly subvention of N327millon to the school. But speaking with newsmen in Uyo, the ASUU chairman, Dr Ime Okop, said his members would remain on strike as long as they do not receive alerts of their salaries and other entitlements, adding that the lecturers were not prepared to shift grounds on the matter.
