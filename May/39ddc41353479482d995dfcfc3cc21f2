By ADEBIYI ADEDAPO | The House of Representatives has opened investigations into the alleged abuses of bidding, contracting, and operating processes by Exxon Mobil against Nigerian-owned catering companies and citizens. Chairman of the House Committee on Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring,  Hon Legor Idagbo at the maiden investigative hearing yesterday said the exercise was not a witch-hunt. “This investigative hearing is not a witch-hunt in any way. We are all Nigerians and what is in the best interest of our country and our citizens should be paramount in our minds. There is no way our indigenes would complain to us and we would fold our hands and not do something about it,” he said. The House on April 21, 2021, during plenary, noted that the American company was reported to have commenced a contract process that favoured foreign companies to the exclusion of indigenous service providers.
