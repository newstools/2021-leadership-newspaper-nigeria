A group, the West African Civil Society Forum (WACSOF), under the Pan Africa State Accountability Project (PASAP) has called on institutions of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to put policies that protect rights of children and women into use. This is as WACSOF, civil society organisations, UNICEF, who are all major stakeholders in the formulation of the ECOWAS Child Policy and Roadmap to Ending Child Marriage, acknowledged the numerous steps taken by the regional body to ensure the adoption of its child policy and roadmap to ending child marriage. The call was made at a WACSOF-organised webinar conference to provide CSOs, organisations and other individuals working on child rights and gender issues a platform to engage with the ECOWAS and give organisations room to state their efforts and progress in the implementation of the child right policy and the road map to ending child marriage. The panelists at the  May 20  webinar include: Ms Deguene Fall UNICEF West and Central Regional Office’s, Regional Gender Adviser, Mr Komlan Messie general secretary WACSOF-FOSCAO, Mr Bertin Some, director of parliamentary  affairs and research, ECOWAS Parliament, Aida Gueye Seydi, supervisor, Pan African States Accountability Programme (PASAP), Plan International, Mdm.
