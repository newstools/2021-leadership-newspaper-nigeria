President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, on his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying that the ruling party “is becoming more popular because of its impressive performance record and commitment to good governance.” In a message delivered on his behalf by Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF) at the defection ceremony in Gusau on Tuesday, President Buhari in a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu said: “I’m proud of your timely and wise decision to join the governing party and our doors are wide open to other politicians who believe in our vision to rebuild Nigeria. “Your voluntary decision to join our party confirms the fact that our agenda for good governance is the only reason why Nigerians are getting attracted to the APC because the other alternative didn’t work.” The President used the occasion to urge APC governors and elected lawmakers across the country “to continue to work harder to ensure our party maintains its popularity and retains power beyond 2023.” He reminded all elected party officials of the fact that “your performance at all levels will impact significantly on the fortunes of the party”, adding that “party leaders should avoid complacency at all times in order to build the APC from strength to strength.”
