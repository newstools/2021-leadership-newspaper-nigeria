Former national publicity secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olisa Metuh, has called on elders and leaders of the South East geo-political zone to urgently convoke a South East Consultative Assembly to address insecurity challenges facing the region. Metuh, who bemoaned the incessant killing, dehumanisation and harassment of Igbos as well as the militarisation of the South East described the situation as “sad and avoidable”. According to Metuh, “There is so much devastation going on in the South East. People are being killed, harassed, victimised and dehumanised. Moreover, the wanton killings and destruction of property being witnessed are very worrisome. This is given the fact that such conduct is completely alien to the Igbos. Such is not in the character of the Igbos. They are unknown to us. “A lot has been said about Igbos which are not true. The people of the South East are egalitarian people. We are peaceful and hardworking. We are not a destructive people. Such is not known in our culture. “It is therefore, time for the Ohaneze Ndi Igbo to rise to the occasion and look into these matters. In this regard, I urge Ohaneze Ndi Igbo to immediately reach out to the chairman of the South East Governors’ Forum, Governor Dave Umahi, as well as Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and convoke a South East Consultative Assembly on the situation in the South East.” Speaking during the visit, president of the Ohaneze Ndi Igbo (FCT) chapter, Chief S O D Onyekwelu, commended Metuh for his concern over the situation in the South East and assured that the Ohaneze Ndi Igbo would commence action towards the convoking of the South East Consultative Forum as proposed by Metuh.
