 A Bride and dozens of passengers who were abducted by suspected members of Boko Haram on Friday afternoon along Maiduguri- Damaturu have regained freedom.  Killings and abduction of citizens have continued unbated on the major highway  which is the major gateway linking people in Borno state to other parts of the country.  Family Source of the freed bride said they received a call from the military in Beneshiekh that the bride including her entourage and other abducted passengers have regained freedom and that they should proceed to Beneshiekh which is along the Maiduguri- Damaturu highway to receive them.
