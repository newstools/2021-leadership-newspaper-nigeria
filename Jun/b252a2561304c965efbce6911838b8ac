The general coordinator of Sabbath Association of Nigeria, Bishop Raphael Nwankwo, has urged Nigerian leaders to adhere to God’s instructions and the nation’s constitution for peace to reign in the country. Nwankwo stated this at the inaugural ceremony of Christ the King Sabbath Mission Church in Nyanya, Abuja, with theme, “The Role of Sabbath Faith in Nation Building.” The Bishop admonished leaders of all sectors, be it religious or political, in Nigeria to follow the laws of God and the Nigerian Constitution if they want to ensure peace and peaceful co-existence among people in the country. According to him, anyone who really follows the law of God ensures justice, equity and progress, adding that the recent turmoil in the nation was not unexpected because the signs are in the Holy Books even as he blames most of Nigeria’s problems on moral decadence. “Nigeria needs to go back to the basics and build the foundation of the family where we are taught to care about each other and that everyone is our family. “I blame Nigeria’s myriad of problems on greed and selfishness. Also, I plead with the Nigerian youths to restrain from violence as it does not solve any problem in the end,” the cleric advised. Also speaking at the occasion, Bishop Godwin Akor, the Northern State coordinator, said that some of the causes of recent unrest in some places across the country, especially in the South-East, were as a result of the feeling of alienation. “The perception of non-inclusiveness in some of the affairs of the nation, whether rightly or wrongly perceived, drives the narrative, and I believe government needs to make deliberate efforts to reach out to the aggrieved. “Government should bridge the gap of communication with the youths of the nation through its agencies responsible for such. “I appeal to government to talk to young people because they are the future,” Akor added.
