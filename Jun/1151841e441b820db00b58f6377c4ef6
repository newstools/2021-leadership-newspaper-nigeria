Kano State governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has approved the request of the chief of naval staff (CNS) Real Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo for the establishment of Desert Warfare Institute in Kano. The chief of policy and plans, Nigerian Navy, Real Admiral COR Ezekobe, announced this when he led a delegation to Governor Ganduje at his office, in Kano, yesterday, to brief the governor on the development so far. Ezekobe said the chief of naval staff made the request for the presence and visibility of the Nigerian Navy in Kano State. This was contained in a statement issued yesterday by the chief press secretary to the governor, Malam Abba Anwar.
The statement quoted Ezekobe as saying, “We are here to actualise the fruitful engagement we had when His Excellency visited us on the 3rd of June, the Chief of Naval Staff directed me to lead this team in actualising some of the promises made to you when you visited the Naval headquarters. ”Appreciating that our project standing on 12 hectares of land, is a multi-purpose project, we are moving our desert warfare of our special unit to Kano.”
He said this unit is highly trained in both the United States of America and Britain, and they are recognised to be the best in terms of performance. While requesting for more land he emphasized that “This is where we will use for a garment industry and other things that will be of significant benefit to the society.” “We would like to develop a Barrack so that when the need arises we can defend ourselves and also the state. That will definitely help in improving the security of the state in particular and the nation in general,” he added. The statement said the chief of naval staff would want to deliver a lecture on Maritime at Bayero University, Kano, or any of the state universities for people in the North to understand the activities of the Nigerian Navy in the national scheme of things.
