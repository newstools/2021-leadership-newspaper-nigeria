Ojora is a member of the Ojora and Adele royal families of Lagos and is himself the holder of the chieftaincy title of the Otunba of Lagos. Saraki is married to Ojora’s daughter, Princess Toyin Ojora-Saraki, who was on Friday installed as Erelu Bobajiro of Iru Land in Lagos State by Oniru of Iru Land, Oba Abdulwasiu Omogbolahan Lawal.
