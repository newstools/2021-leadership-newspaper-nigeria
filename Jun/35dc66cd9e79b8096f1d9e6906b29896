While signing the agreement, the vice-chancellor, Professor Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah, said collaborations between universities and industries were known to have driven the economy of the most advanced nations of the world, and added that it was high time educational institutions and business in Nigeria began to work closely together to drive national development. Professor Na’Allah assured ACCI that the University was ready to play its role in accordance with world best practices to ensure that the partnership would have significant impact on the Nigerian economy. ‘’I assure you that I will give this collaboration my total support.    I want to make sure that our students benefit tremendously from the initiative and even more than that, that our nation benefits tremendously from its implementation,” Na’Allah said.
