Senator representing Kwara North in the National Assembly, Sadiq Umar, has organised empowerment programme for farmers and herders so as to foster unity between the two groups. The lawmaker distributed antibiotics, vaccines and de-worming medication to herdsmen for 1000 cattle and other animals in Kaiama, Baruten, Edu, Patigi and Moro local government areas of Kwara North. He equally distributed pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers to farmers in the five local government areas. Senator Umar also awarded scholarship to 105 undergraduates, Master’s and PhD degrees students. Speaking at the ceremony, Kwara State governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, noted that Kwara North is the critical food supplier of the state and some neighbouring states. Represented by his deputy, Mr Kayode Alabi, the governor advised the beneficiaries of the empowerment programme to ensure that they use the chemicals and fertilizers properly for a bountiful harvest. “We thank you for helping Kwara State government because it cannot do it alone. We encourage other Senators, House of Representatives and the State House of Assembly members to emulate this gesture in order to reduce poverty,” AbdulRazaq stated. Governor AbdulRazaq noted that education is the bedrock of individuals and societal development, adding that no individual or society could make tangible progress without quality education. He said education is pivotal in every sector of the nation’s life, including agriculture, adding that: “In recognition of this, the government has prioritised the empowerment of farmers with necessary skills and support.”
