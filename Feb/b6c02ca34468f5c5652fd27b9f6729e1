Super Falcons captain Asisat Oshoala said two of Nigeria’s musicians, Wizkid and 2Face Idibia, played a key role in reshaping her football career. The Barcelona star, who rose from grass to grace, starting with FC Robo Queen to playing her football in Europe, revealed how Wizkid and 2Face’s songs kept her dream alive even in the face of difficulties. Oshoala became a household name after her blistering performance at the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, where she finished as the top scorer and the best player at the tournament. Speaking with FIFA Playon Podcast, the four time Africa women footballer of the year award winners said, “I mean it quite emotional for me because it made me think back. “I started remembering how things were difficult. I had to leave my family, create my own space, create my happiness even out of nothing. “So for me, I just had to flashback and started picking songs that as of that period were the banging songs. That kept me going. That built me up. So that was how I picked mine. “I think during that period, the song (2baba’s Ifana Ibaga) and Wizkid’s Ojuelegba was more like some inspirational songs to have. I was quite young, anyways. It was just the lyrics. “Then, when the video came out, I watched it, I could relate with the video and the words. It was more like a thing that actually fit into my day to day life during that period.”
