BY GEORGE OKOJIE, Lagos Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday raised the alarm over the surge in the number of emerging third wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the state, warning that the general public risks losing both lives and livelihood on a devastating scale if it goes out of control. The governor who disclosed this in a press statement he signed and made available to journalists to provide update on coronavirus pandemic situation in the state and ongoing response of the state government, said 60,202 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in the state. He said, ‘’From the beginning of July, we started to experience a steep increase in the number of daily confirmed cases, with the test positivity rate going from 1.1 per cent at the end of June 2021 to its current rate of 6.6 per cent as at 8th of July, 2021. “The rapid increase within a week gives great cause for concern. Also, within the last two weeks, the occupancy rate at our two isolation centres increased from an average of one per cent to six per cent. This is the new and disturbing reality that now confronts us. But we must not be demoralised by this. We must instead resolve that we will not leave any stone unturned in our bid to effectively mitigate the third wave of this pandemic in Lagos State. “As you all know, Lagos has been the epicentre of the pandemic since the start, and the way we manage it here has a significant impact and reverberating effect on the national outlook and outcomes.” So, Nigeria is counting on us in Lagos State to be resolute in our stand against the virus.  ‘’We will continue to test aggressively. We will also focus on sequencing the samples we are collecting to ensure we are detecting and keeping track of the different variants in circulation.  ‘’It is only by testing and sequencing comprehensively that we can collect the data required for informed decision-making. Epidemiology Update As at the 7th of July 2021, Lagos State had recorded a total of 60,202 confirmed cases of COVID-19.  ‘’Of this number, 55,135 have recovered in-community and 770 are currently being managed actively in-community.
