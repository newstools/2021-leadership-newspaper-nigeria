BY OLUSHOLA BELLO, Lagos The bears will maintain leadership on the Nigerian stock market this week as investors remain on the lookout for new stop rates, especially for 364-day bills.
Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited said: “with the first quarter (Q1), 2021 earnings season now out of the way, we believe a ‘choppy theme’ will be the order of the day as investors keep their gaze on yield movements in the fixed income (FI) market. “The bears will likely maintain dominance as the absence of positive triggers will limit buying interest from the bulls. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” This week, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited expected the stock market to trade sideways as investors remain on the lookout for new stop rates, especially for 364-day bills. Hence, bargain hunters can seize the opportunity to position in dividend paying stocks, particularly those that offer above 10 per cent dividend yield.

The banking sector remains attractive on the back of the prevailing low prices, despite the Q1 mixed numbers.” He also pointed out that the market has moved out of its trading range, saying that the market may discount the prospects of high cap companies and some blue chip stocks, ahead of their earnings reports. He, however, added that, the pullbacks offer bargain hunters and income investors fresh opportunities to reposition in high dividend yields and undervalued stocks, while looking out for quarterly numbers that would support recovery, saying that this is based on the fact that the rising fixed income yields may not be enough to scare all investors away from the equity market. “Again, the way to go is to target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities. This is especially given the rising oil prices that have so far supported the economy and equity market, despite the seeming improvement in the fixed income yield which had remained at negative real rate of return due to the subsisting high inflation,” Omordion said. He explained further that “the current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for the short, medium and long-term, which is why investors should target fundamentally sound, and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation in the new year.”
