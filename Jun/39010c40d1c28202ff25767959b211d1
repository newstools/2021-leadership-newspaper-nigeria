The Federal Government has berated Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, over his fake tweet and misinformation on the death of the Registrar of National Examinations Council (NECO), Prof. Godswill Obioma. Odinkalu, a former Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission had tweeted that Obioma was strangled to death contrary to what the family of the deceased said. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said Odinkalu acted irresponsibly by the fake tweet. “Without mincing words, the action of Prof. Odinkalu is the height of irresponsibility that is at variance with someone of his pedigree.

The minister reiterated his position that fake news and misinformation constituted grave danger and monster that might not be easily tamed. He recalled that his ministry had inaugurated the campaign against fake news, hate speech and misinformation since 2017.
