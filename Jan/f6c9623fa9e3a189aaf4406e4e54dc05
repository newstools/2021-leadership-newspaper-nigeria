By Jonathan Nda- Isaiah, The African Centre for Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR) has observed with regrets the daily significant increase in infections by COVID-19 being recorded in Nigeria as being released by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The centre in a statement by its executive director, Barr Nduka- Edede Chinwendu also noted that a huge number of the nation’s citizens are being infected daily while joining crowds in their various states across the country to register for the National Identity Number (NIN) being carried out by the Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC). The ACJHR is of the view that the further spread of COVID-19 can be curtailed if the Federal Government rises up to its duty of protecting lives. According to them , there is no doubt that the lives of helpless Nigerians who are joining huge crowd daily in their bid to get registered are being exposed to the dreaded virus. He said “Lack of crowd control has so far characterised the ongoing exercise nationwide, therefore making social distancing which is one of the major non-pharmaceutical measures recommended to curtail the spread of the virus practically impossible. “It is a national shame to continue to see pictures and videos of crowds besieging registration centres at a time the same government is asking citizens to stay at home and avoid gatherings. “It is clear that more Nigerians are being infected daily from the registration centres. “The ACJHR therefore called  on the Federal Government to stop the ongoing registration if indeed it is serious with its acclaimed commitment to curtailing the spread of the virus. “We shall henceforth hold the government responsible for any further increase in the number of infections in the country if it fails to stop the exercise forthwith.”
