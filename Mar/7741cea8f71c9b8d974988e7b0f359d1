Both players signed long term contracts with the club for an undisclosed fee. Gent have long history of signing Nigerian players with the like of former Super Eagles captain and coach Augustine Eguaveon stood like a rock in the heart of their defence in the 90s, while the current Super Eagles stars like Peter Olayinka, Samuel Kalu and Moses Simon were all household names during their glorious years in Belgian side. Highly promising goal machine, Chinonso, has already opened his goal account for the club when he scored for the team’s Under 21 side in their 1-1 draw before he featured for the senior team in their 4-1 win over Oostende in a friendly game. Defensive midfielder Oladoye Adewale also impressed in their 4-1 win.

He is mighty and must be praised at all times.” The likes of Babatunde Micheal, Gabriel Okechukwu and Success Makanjuola all plying their football trades abroad were once graduates of Water FC of Abuja, the home of the next Nigerian super star.
