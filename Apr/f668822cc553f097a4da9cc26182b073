For those who did not win anything, it is not yet over. It is just a starting point or a planning stage. So, you have not lost anything, but you are planning to do better. For those who won, you most sustain the momentum. if you trained for 10 before to get this feat, you are now going to train for 30 minutes to move to the peak. I’m impressed and well pleased with you for making the people of Nasarawa State proud,” Adam said.
