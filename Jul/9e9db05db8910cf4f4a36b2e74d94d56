Power Forward, a youth development initiative, launched in 2013 by the ExxonMobil Foundation, the NBA and PanAfricare, uses basketball to teach health literacy, including malaria prevention and personal hygiene, and life skills, such as leadership, respect and responsibility, to students in 30 secondary schools in the FCT. Speaking during the 8th annual stakeholders’ meeting of the Power Forward Project Forum, the country director, PanAfricare, Patrick Adah, said, “Each public health event, the students are engaged, basketball is to bring them together and we use that opportunity to create awareness on public heath interventions going on in the country so that they can also be vanguard and contribute their quota.” The annual event engages project partners and critical decision makers to communicate, inform and outline the project’s implementation strategy for the project year. It also provides an opportunity to hear from these decision makers, get their feedback and outline next steps on project implementation strategies.
