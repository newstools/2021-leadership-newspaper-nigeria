India has vaccinated at least 381,305 people since its nationwide program started on Saturday, according to a press conference by the country’s Health Ministry on Monday. On Monday alone, 148,266 people received injections. India has given emergency approval to vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and a local pharmaceutical company, Bharat Biotech. It is unclear the breakdown of drugs used in the vaccine program’s initial stage. Health Ministry officials also reported 580 instances where people reported adverse events following immunisation and that seven people were hospitalized. Two deaths have also been reported, but officials say evidence does not suggest it was caused by the vaccine. A 53-year-old man in northern Uttar Pradesh state died on Sunday morning, a day after receiving the vaccine. A post mortem report revealed the cause of death due to cardiopulmonary disease. In southern Karnataka state, a 43-year-old man passed away on Monday after receiving the vaccine on Saturday with the cause of death also linked to cardiopulmonary failure. “These deaths are not related to the vaccination according to the post mortem report,” health ministry officials stressed at a press conference on Monday.
