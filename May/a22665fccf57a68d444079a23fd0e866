The command had, in a press statement by the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Yusuf Mariam, said, “The attention of the FCT Joint Security Team has been drawn to a viral publication in the social media purporting that the ‘Federal Capital Territory is under the attack of Boko Haram Terrorists’. ”The Joint Security Team of the FCT wishes to refute the mischievous publication targeted at creating palpable tension amongst the well-spirited residents of the FCT.”  We’re Monitoring Situation – Police Meanwhile, following the social media report of invasion of Bwari axis of the FCT by suspected Boko Haram terrorist, bandits or kidnappers, the Nigeria Police have said they monitoring the situation.

Parents and family members of the kidnapped students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Igabi local government area of Kaduna State can now heave a sigh of relief after they were released by their abductors yesterday. According to the chairman of the parents committee, Malam Abdullahi Usman, 27 of the students who were in the captivity of the abductors were released unharmed.

Earlier, 10 of the students were released in two batches of five each after it was reported that ransom was paid.
When asked whether ransom was paid for the release of the 27 students, Usman declined to speak on it, stressing that the parents worked tirelessly, including reaching out to prominent persons to assist towards their release. “We are indeed thankful to former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Kaduna-based Islamic scholar Sheikh Ahmad Gumi among others for their roles towards the eventual release of the students. “We also thank the journalists who helped to publicise our cries and worries, and Nigerians who encouraged and prayed with us for the safe release of our children. We are indeed grateful and pray that God will bless them all,” he said. The parents of the students had on Tuesday stormed the National Assembly in Abuja to protest the continued holding of their children in captivity and government’s apparent indifference over their abduction.

Don’t Pay Ransom To Bandits, Obasanjo Warns
Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday called on the federal government to stop payment of ransom to kidnappers and bandits, saying the practice is currently fueling the problem of insecurity in the country. Obasanjo spoke while hosting members of the Tiv Professionals Group (TPG) led by Prof Zacharys Anger Gundu who visited him at his Pent House residence located within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. He urged the Federal Government to evolve a more effective means of tackling insecurity, particularly the menace of kidnapping and other banditry currently ravaging the country rather than paying ransom to the bandits. Obasanjo specifically advocated for a, “carrot and heavy stick” approach to fighting insecurity in Nigeria to a standstill, emphasizing that paying ransom to kidnappers further go a long way at encouraging banditry to flourish. He also declared that those beating drums of division in Nigeria never meant well about the interest of the minority ethnic groups in the country.
Obasanjo told the YPG that leaders across all divides in the country must ensure the year 2023 general election birth the emergence of a new federation in Nigeria failure of which he said the country could be “sliding into ground dissolution”. Obasanjo, who bemoaned security challenges, said he does not believe in payment of ransom to kidnappers and banditry as it encouraged criminals indulging in the act. He specifically noted that President Muhammadu Buhari’s government and that of his predecessor, Dr Goodluck Jonathan had paid ransom to kidnappers and bandits, but denied it. The former president however, insisted that the year 2023 general election must mark a watershed for Nigeria. “I do believe that whatever else we do we have to make the year 2023 a watershed for Nigeria. The year 2023 should give us the beginning of emergence of a new federation or feeling that the rot continues and then, we are going to be sliding back to ground dissolution. God forbid”, the former President said. “Some people are still reaching out, and hoping that lives can still be saved. But a situation whereby anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is folly. He is a folly. This is because when you pay ransom, you encourage. But if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it. “Government has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during Jonathan (administration), they paid ransom, but they denied it”. “I believe that if we will get it right in Nigeria, any leader must look at Nigeria with the prism of the diversity of Nigeria. For as long as you look at Nigeria with the prism of your ethnic group, then you aren’t going anywhere, either your ethnic group or religious group. But is there hope? There is hope”. Presenting a paper earlier, leader of the group, Prof Zacharys Anger Gundu told Obasanjo that, “blood is flowing in Benue State” following killings of the people allegedly by Fulanis and bandits. He said people are being maimed in their sleep and on their ancestral land, calling on Obasanjo and other influential Nigerians to rise to the occasion to stem the tide of killings. While alleging skewed security architecture, Gundu said “Nigeria seems to be losing the battle against insecurity. He, however, demanded that full compensation for the victims of killings and destruction in Tivland, proscription of armed Fulani groups, while “land grabbing must stop and all occupied lands must be vacated.” Gundu also called for intensified advocacy against nomadic pastoralism and hosting “all Nationalities Summit” where issues would be discussed with a view to finding lasting solutions. “There are different shades of instability in the country. Nigeria is truly bleeding to death. There’s even a population fault-line which could lead to the ‘Lebanon Trap’ “All Patriots must stand together; but if others have to be enslaved before the country can survive, we will prefer, as Tiv people, to take our destiny in our hands.” …As DSS Denies Arresting Fr. Mbaka
In another matter, the spokesperson of the Department of State Services, Dr Peter Afunanya, has denied report of the service arresting Fr Ejike Mbaka.
According to him when asked if Fr Mbaka was in their custody, he said, “This is not true. Fr Mbaka was not picked up by the DSS. Rev Fr Mbaka is not with the DSS. The DSS did not pick him up, please.” There was anxiety in Enugu after the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide (OYC) raised the alarm over the whereabouts of Fr Mbaka.
The spiritual director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Rev. Fr. Mbaka later resurfaced after he was declared ‘missing.’ But the cleric returned to Enugu around 2pm and came out of his vehicle to the joy of his supporters. Mbaka has been in the news after he asked President Muhammadu Buhari to resign or be impeached for failing to secure the nation and provide jobs for the youths.
