Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, has said his administration is considering constituting a taskforce in the next eight weeks to implement the ban on open grazing in the state. The governor, who stated this in Ogbomoso during a Town Hall meeting in commemoration of the second anniversary of the government, held at the Soun Ogunlola Hall, Oja-Igbo, Ogbomoso, said that open grazing was illegal in the state. He added that the government will continually engage the people of the state in the budget process, adding that a government team that will collate data for the next budget will soon embark on consultations with the communities. The governor assured the people that his government would soon create an alternative road to the Ibadan/Oyo/Ogbomoso Expressway, a federal road which he said had been under construction for too long. According to him, the state government will construct the Iseyin/Ogbomoso road to link the Ibadan/Iseyin road already constructed and ensure that travelers going to Ogbomoso bypass the traffic snare on the federal road. He said, ‘’In Oyo State, open grazing is against the law. The implementation plan will come out within the next six to eight weeks. So, to my brother from Oriire who spoke about open grazing, the Task Force will not be for Oriire alone, it will cut across Oyo State. “So, whoever goes against the law in this state will face the wrath of law and that is just it. “And concerning all the requests on road construction, we will plan ahead. Some of these projects will be included in the budget that we are going to come up with next year because we have to work with the fund in government coffers.’’ “When you engage with our team on budget, which will be going round very soon, make sure some of these roads are mentioned  and I give you my promise that we will do all we can to ensure the right things are done.”
