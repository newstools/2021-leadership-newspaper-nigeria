Borno State governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, has said President Muhammadu Buhari would be in the state today to appraise the security situation and commission some projects executed by his administration. In a statewide broadcast on Wednesday evening ahead of the president’s visit, the governor said Buhari would commission the first phase of 10,000 houses, which he approved and funded, for the resettlement of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. The governor said he was happy to confirm to the people that the federal government has completed 4,000 of the 10,000 housing units approved for IDPs, adding that some of them were sited in Kaleri, Dalori and other places. Zulum said, “Fellow citizens, the 10,000 houses approved by Buhari is so far the largest federal government housing intervention, sited in one state.
“Let me also add, that our ongoing housing resettlement is only made possible by the relative peace in most of our local government areas. “While I must admit that we still have security challenges, at the same time, if we cast our minds back to the realities before President Buhari’s coming, we would factually recall, that many of our communities in northern, central and southern Borno, were mostly, no-go-areas. “President is focused on our security situation. President Buhari has regularly demonstrated deep compassion and love for Borno State.” Zulum said not long ago, President Buhari gave approva for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), to establish a power plant for the people of Borno, adding that the president’s gesture was aimed at addressing electricity problems in Maiduguri and environs.
