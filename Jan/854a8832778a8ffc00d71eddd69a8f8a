Governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) said yesterday that they were committed to making all states under their control models of good governance with records of rapid human development this year. Kebbi State governor and chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Atiku Bagudu, in a New Year message noted that the decision of the APC governors was in line with the principles of social democracy, provisions of the APC’s constitution and manifesto. He said, “In 2021, we shall continue to take all the necessary steps to roll out programmes that will consolidate the development of synergy, experience sharing and collaboration by all progressive states. “The PGF felicitates with all Nigerians on this festive season and reiterate our commitment to the unity and development of Nigeria, development of our democratic institutions while putting in place genuine programmes to bring an end to Covid-19 pandemic, tackle insecurity, fight crime, destroy all vestiges of corruption and create jobs and opportunities for all Nigerians. “This would remain the basis of our programmes for massive infrastructural projects that would stimulate economic activity, reduce inequality and diminish poverty”. The APC governors also advised Nigerians not to reduce issues of security and health posed by bandits and COVID-19 to politics. They stated: “The challenge before us as a nation is to ensure the development of democratic institutions in the country, mobilise effective national responses and resolution of the health challenges created by the pandemic, the economic difficulty and the security challenges facing the country. “These are not issues that should be reduced to politics. We must appeal to all Nigerian to have a strong sense of national unity and togetherness in responding to these challenges”.
