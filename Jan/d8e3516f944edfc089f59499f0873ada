An 18-year-old boy, Muhammad Abubakar, on Thursday, appeared before an Upper Area Court, Zuba, Abuja, for allegedly stabbing a man.
The defendant, of Kado Bimbo, across Gwarinpa expressway, Abuja, was charged with joint act, criminal force, assault and causing hurt.
The Prosecution Counsel, Chinedu Agada, told the court that the complainant, Monday Lazarus, reported the matter at Gwarinpa police station on Oct. 25, 2020.
