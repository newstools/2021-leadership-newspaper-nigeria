By Anthony Ada Abraham, YBNL artiste, Fireboy DML went home with four awards from the 14th Headies award ceremony which was held at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos on Sunday Feb. 21, 2021. Even with the COVID-19 pandemic which threatened the Nigeria’s top music award, it was held with strict COVID-19 guidelines. Beautifully dressed celebrities with their charming attire adorned the screens and social media as many including those from the movie Industry were on hand to lend their support to the finest in the industry. The hosts for this year’s edition were Nancy Isime and comedian Bovi who drew attention to the EndSars protest with a shirt he wore. High point of the night was when Oxlade and Bella Shmurda who were nominated in same category with Omah Lay came out to receive the Next Rated award, far from what happened in previous editions. The best Next Rated appearances so far. It could be recalled that Olamide fought with Don Jazzy after he claimed his artiste, Lil Kesh was hotter than Reekado Banks who won the award. Also on social media, Desmond Elliot was roasted by tweeter nation for his outburst during the EndSars protest. It seems he hasn’t be forgiven.
