Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United romped to a 4-0 victory over Real Sociedad in their Europa League last-32 first leg yesterday, while Gareth Bale impressed for Tottenham in a 4-1 thrashing of Austrian side Wolfsberg. The Premier League outfit grabbed the lead in the 27th minute when Fernandes pounced on a defensive mix-up to slot in from Marcus Rashford’s clipped pass. Solskjaer’s men doubled their advantage 12 minutes into the second period as Fernandes stroked home his 21st goal of the season. United continued to play at a pace Sociedad could not deal with and Rashford finally got his goal in the 65th minute following a blistering counter-attack started by goalkeeper Dean Henderson. The tie was surely put to bed in the final minute of normal time as Daniel James raced clear and fired into the bottom corner. Arsenal youngster Bukayo Saka continued his excellent season as his sixth goal of the campaign cancelled out Pizzi’s penalty in a 1-1 draw against Benfica at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. “I feel like I’m improving every game. I’m trying to impress, trying to learn,” said Saka. “I just want to keep progressing.” Leicester, sitting third in the Premier League, were held to a goalless draw at Slavia Prague, but there was plenty of excitement elsewhere. AC Milan, who have not reached the quarterfinals of any European competition since the 2011-12 Champions League, had to settle for a 2-2 draw at Red Star Belgrade. Milan, who face Inter in a top-of-the-table Serie A derby on Sunday, were pegged back as Milan Pavkov netted a dramatic 93rd-minute leveller for Red Star, who played the closing stages with 10 men.
