All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain and former member of the House of Representatives, who represented Yagba Federal Constituency of Kogi State, Hon Karimi Sunday, yesterday said the North should retain the presidency in 2023 in the interest of equity and justice. The former lawmaker, in a statement in Abuja, said since the 1999 power rotation agreement between North and South has ended in the North, it must restart with the North retaining it. He urged the political class to key into the smooth arrangement on ground and not overheat the system with what he called “unnecessary controversy as to which part of the country should produce the next president.” The 17 governors under the aegis of Southern Governors’ Forum had resolved, at a meeting in Lagos two weeks ago, that Nigeria’s next president must come from the South. But Sunday said, “In the interest of equity and natural Justice, North will still produce the nation’s President come 2023, why? Since 1999, the rotation started from the South and ended in the North. It must start from where it ended, as it is the normal practice for a rotational agreement anywhere in the world
