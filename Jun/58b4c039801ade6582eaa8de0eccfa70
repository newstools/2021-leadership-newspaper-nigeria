To access the premade investment rank lists and in-depth analyst reports, you will need to join Zacks Premium. This service costs $249 per year after a 30-day free trial. While any investor can benefit from Zacks Premium, it’s probably a better option if you follow a particular investment strategy. The Zacks stock screener can filter by: Growth Value Earning Surprises Best Industries While Zacks has a robust stock screener, its “Rank Lists” can be an effective way to find stocks. There are lists for different industries and investing strategies. Zacks also assigns each potential investment a score. A higher score indicates the stock may have better investment performance. In addition to the Zacks Rank Lists, you can read in-depth reports for each stock. These reports can describe the current pros and cons. At $249 a year (after the 30-day free trial), you do get valuable research. Keep in mind you’ll have to invest more money so your investment returns can “pay” the annual subscription fee.

You can filter your stock screener by growth, value, earning surprises, and best industry. The subscription fee is higher than most.  Learn More Seeking Alpha is arguably one of the best free investment sites.

This newsletter lets me quickly track any recent moves for the positions I hold and stocks on my watchlist. You can also read articles to get investing ideas and review market commentary from Seeking Alpha contributors. There are articles that list the bull case and bear case for a stock or ETF. I use these articles during the research phase to better understand an investment recommendation before deciding to buy or avoid.

If you’ve ever read a copy of The Wall Street Journal, then you will be familiar with Barron’s content format. The same parent company owns both publications, but Barron’s focuses on stock investing while the Journal is better for business news and current events.

The top sites can highlight some of the best (and worst) potential investments.  Nonetheless, you will still need to perform your own research to decide if their recommendations fit your investment strategy.  For example, investing in a fast-growing tech stock probably isn’t a good idea when you want a blue-chip dividend stock.  If the investment site charges a fee, you must decide if the quality of research is worth the cost. When the answer is “yes,” you must decide if you will buy enough stocks to justify the fee.  The Right Way to Buy Individual Stocks Many online brokers make it easy to buy stocks without fees. Unfortunately, brokers won’t provide individual advice, so it can be easy to make a risky portfolio. These suggestions may help you as you start investing.  Diversify Your Portfolio Buying stocks that have the most exciting headlines or investing in brands that you use can make things simple.  However, some brokers and investing sites may recommend a model portfolio of domestic and international stock and bond sectors.  You can use this recommendation to find stocks and funds that fit the recommended sectors and asset allocation.  If you have yet to invest your first dollar, consider investing in index funds and target date retirement funds first.  These funds give you exposure to most publicly traded stocks and instant diversification with low fees. As a result, you can minimize your portfolio risk.  How Much Stock to Buy When buying stocks, it’s important to pay attention to asset allocation. You don’t want one stock to be too large of a position in your portfolio.  For instance, if a single stock is 50% of your portfolio value and the share price goes to zero, you lose half of your money.  To limit your downside risk, you may consider only having a maximum 5% portfolio allocation for each stock you buy. This means that if you have $10,000 in your brokerage account, each stock position might only be $500.  Other investors might invest as much as 15% of their portfolio in one stock. Make sure you are comfortable with the amount of stock you buy. With each purchase, make sure you maintain a diversified portfolio.  When you invest small amounts of money, you may assign a 1% or 2% allocation per stock. If the stock fails and it’s just a 2% allocation, you will only lose a small amount of cash.  Assigning a small allocation can also be good when you invest in risky stocks with a volatile share price.  Avoid Common Investing Mistakes It’s not uncommon for new investors to have some blunders when they first get started. Investment sites may help you minimize the number of missteps you make.  Using investment sites to purchase stocks can help you avoid these common mistakes:  Investing in company stock just because you work there Only buying stock for brands you use Trading stocks on headlines Investing in stocks without understanding the company’s business model Having a single position that’s too large for your risk tolerance Not performing your own due diligence Always remember that stock investing isn’t a “get rich quick” scheme.  Do Your Research You have many options when it comes to investing. You can use robo-advisors, mobile apps, personal retirement accounts such as IRAs, or investment management companies such as Charles Schwab or Fidelity to manage your investments.  Investment sites help educate you on the best trading platforms, exchange-traded funds, cryptocurrency and other investing platforms.  Although there are successful day traders and momentum traders, most successful investors follow the “buy and hold” approach and ignore the periodic share price dips.  This is why it’s so important to get investment advice from a third-party resource. Investing in stocks and ETFs can be easy if you use the proper resources and information to manage your investment accounts.
