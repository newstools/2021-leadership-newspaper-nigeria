The federal government has announced the reopening of the passport application and payment portal effective from June 8, 2021 by 12 midnight, to allow eligible passport applicants apply and make payments for the various categories of passports of their choice. A statement signed by the assistant comptroller of immigration service/public relations officer of the Nigeria Immigrations Service, Amos Okpu, on behalf of the Comptroller General, which was made available to LEADERSHIP in Abuja on Tuesday, said with the reopening of the portal, a new passport application and payment regime has commenced. The statement added that applications and payments for passport services shall be made through the service website: www.immigration.gov.ng, while applicants are expected to visit the portal to apply and upload their support documents for vetting and processing. Okpu said a chatroom feature to guide applicants through the application and payment process has been provided on the portal, adding that upon successful application, applicants shall make their online booking interview/enrollment appointment on any day, time and location they consider convenient. He said that the new timeline for oassport production and issuance after a successful enrollment at the selected issuing centre shall be six weeks for fresh applications and three weeks for renewal applications, adding that no applicant who is yet to make online application and payment shall be allowed into any of the Passport Issuing Centres for passport processing. The statement added that the Comptroller General of NIS, Muhammad Babandede, has called on Nigerians and indeed passport applicants to avoid patronising touts as the entire process has been made seamless for effective and efficient service delivery, even as he warned passport racketeers to desist from acts capable of undermining the reform efforts to avoid strict sanctions.
