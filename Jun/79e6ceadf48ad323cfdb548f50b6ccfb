Capital market analysts attributed the bearish sentiment to investors’ sell-off in medium and large capitalised stocks, amidst rise in the yield of federal government’s June savings bond. The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks, amongst which are Guaranty Trust Bank, Unilever, Lafarge Africa, Union Bank of Nigeria and FCMG Group. Analysts at United Capital Plc predicted that negative sentiments would dominate the equities market this week following suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria. “We expect negative sentiments to dominate the equities market as knee-jerk reactions to the federal government’s decision to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria kicks in. “That said, we think the possible dips created by sell pressures may present decent entry points for buy orders,” they noted.
