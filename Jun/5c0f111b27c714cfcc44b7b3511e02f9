The Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly (KDHA), Rt. Honourable Yusuf Ibrahim Zailani, has said that prioritising sports in governance will help greatly in bringing an end to insurgency, banditry and other forms of criminality ravaging the country. He stated this on Thursday while declaring open a 3-day workshop on coaching, management and psychology organised by his SSA on youth, sports and culture, Hon. Abubakar Adams Ekene, at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna. “To end the growing army of willing tools in the hands of bandits and insurgents, we need to put on our thinking caps and engage them positively through sports. “All available options must be explored, including the economic angle, which will put food on more tables of our citizens and youth,” Zailani stated. He described the workshop as another milestone achievement of the Malam Nasir el-Rufai-led administration in job creation and empowerment of youths. “I am highly delighted to be part of yet another historic moment, this is because sports, besides ensuring that we remain healthy, is a huge income earner and has the potential of employing several youths.” The Speaker therefore, urged all the participants to concentrate and learn all that the resource persons will be impacting on them. “I have full confidence in the resource persons, knowing that they are coming all the way from the National Institute of Sports (NIS) and the certificates the participants will be issued will be accepted anywhere in the world,” he said. Speaking on behalf of the resource persons, former Super Eagles coach, Austin Equavon said, they are prepared to give the right knowledge to the participants. “I am happy to see the enthusiasm on the faces of the participants and we will not let them down. Sports is a veritable tool to take the youths off the streets and this is a good opportunity to better their lives” he stressed.
