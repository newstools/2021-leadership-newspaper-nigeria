In her remarks, the Executive Secretary WARDC , Dr Abiola Akiyode – Afolabi , disclosed that statistics from  the International Federation of Women Lawyers ( FIDA ) , showed that over 39 rape cases were recorded in Borno state within two months of the COVID-19 lockdown. She said the WARDC project is engaging the parliament and state governments on the need to have the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Law, noting that as it is today, the law has gotten to second reading and that WARDC will work to ensure that the law is passed because of its benefits to the society. She said:” Most of the cases of sexual and gender based violence go unreported in places like Borno and Yobe states because the culture of reporting is not integrated yet to the communities. So the project is to ensure more reporting of SBGV.
