  You will recall I that I watched the last NWPL Super Four final at the  Agege Stadium, Lagos where I saw great exhibition of talents. I want to congratulate the overall winner and those who will represent us for the first time in the Female CAF Champions League to be our worthy representatives  by perhaps winning the maiden Trophy of the CAF Champions League.
