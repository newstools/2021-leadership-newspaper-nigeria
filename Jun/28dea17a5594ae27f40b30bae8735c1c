The hope of popular Yoruba actor, Omiyinka Olanrewaju popularly known as Baba Ijesha to regain temporary freedom was yesterday dashed by a Lagos State magistrates court in Yaba area of the state. The actor, who was arraigned before the court for defilement sexual assault, was denied bail by the court because it held that the court lack the jurisdiction to try the charge with which the defendant was docked. The Magistrate Peter Nwaka, while ruling on the bail application moved by the defendant’s lawyer, held that it is only the High Court that has jurisdiction to hear the case. He further held that, “Since there are indications that the matter is before the High Court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given.”
He, however, directed the Correctional Officers to give full medical attention to the defendant pending his arraignment at the High Court.
The defence counsel, Kayode Olabiran had urged the court to grant his client bail, citing his deteriorating health. He said the controversial nature of the case has made it difficult to secure his release despite his bail as intending sureties were scared of the likely consequences. Baba Ijesha was arraigned before the court by the police on a five-count charge of indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a Child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault.
