Domestic animals have taken over the four council wards in Kastina-Ala local government area of Benue State ransacked by herdsmen few days ago, LEADERSHIP has learnt. The chairman of the council Hon Alfred Atera in an interview with LEADERSHIP said he visited Utange, one of the affected wards and discovered that all residents had deserted the area. “There are a lot of domestic animals everywhere and there are no humans beings in the villages. The locals have ran away from their ancestral homes, it is that bad,” he said. According to the chairman, the displaced people are in their thousands. He noted that many of the displaced are now seeking shelter in Abaji, Tor- Donga and Haaga and some other villages close to the main roads Atera said, “Some of the displaced persons who spoke with me said, the herdsmen are still in the bush chasing them from their homes, though I did not see any of them. As we speak no farming activity is going on in the villages I visited because the people have fled.” The council chairman disclosed that security personnel are already patrolling the communities. He informed that he has also requested that the police and troops of Operation Whirl Stroke be deployed to Abaji in order to protect the community and the main market. He also informed that he would be visiting Yooyo council ward for on-the-spot assessment of the community today (Thursday).
