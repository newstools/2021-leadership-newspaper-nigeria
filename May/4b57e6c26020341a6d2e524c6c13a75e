BY OUR CORRESPONDENT | The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), on Thursday, mourned Pastor Dare Adeboye, the third child of the church General Overseer, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, saying he served the Lord without reserve. The 42-year-old Dare died in his sleep on Wednesday in Eket, Akwa Ibom State, where he was based with his family. In an official statement on Thursday via its verified Twitter handle, @rccghq, the church said though it was shaken by the sudden death of the young cleric, its anchor remained Jesus Christ. “It is with a deep and heartfelt sense of loss, we announce the departure of our beloved son, brother, husband and father, Oluwadamilare Temitayo Adeboye, who went to be with the Lord on the 4th of May, 2021. “His life was well lived as he served the Lord without reserve, giving effortlessly and leading fearlessly. He was crowned by the Lord with blessings of 3 seeds and a beautiful wife. “Though shaken, our anchor remains Jesus Christ in whom we have the assurance that we will one day meet in a place where there is no pain. It is the wish of the family to be granted privacy at this moment and that prayers be offered on their behalf.” Dare was born on June 9, 1978 and would have clocked 43 in June.
