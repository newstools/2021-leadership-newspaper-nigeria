A police Sergeant, Mr Kabiru Isah, has returned N1.2 million recovered from an accident scene to relatives of a deceased accident victim in Kano State. The Kano State police spokesman, ASP Abdullahi Haruna, revealed in a statement  yesterday in Kano that the policeman attached to the command’s Motor Traffic Division (MTD) recovered the money while conducting analysis at an accident scene on the Kano-Zaria road. He said an articulated vehicle had knocked down a motorcycle rider who died on the spot, adding that the victim was in possession of the money packed in a box. “The police officer returned N1,294,200 found at the scene of the fatal accident,” he said. Haruna said the commissioner of police, Mr Sama’ila Dikko, handed over the money to the relatives of the deceased and called on police personnel and residents of the state to emulate Isah’s good deed. According to him, the managing director, Kano Road Traffic Agency (KAROTA), Mr Baffa Dan-Agundi, gifted Isah with N100,000 as reward for his honesty and dedication to duty.
