United Kingdom (UK) through its foreign and commonwealth development office (FCDO) will inject Â£90million into Jigawa State comprehensive development framework in the next five years. The development director of foreign commonwealth and development office (FCDO Nigeria), Dr Christopher Pyco, told newsmen after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for five year with the state government that the partnership will focus on assisting Jigawa to strengthen its system for effective public service delivery in health, education, climate change, and accountability. Pyco said UK had enjoyed good partnership with Jigawa State in the last 20 years and the new partnership will commence by assisting the state to review its comprehensive development framework (CDF) and that they will keep evaluating its implementation after every six month. After he signed the MoU at Dutse Government House, Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, commended UK for its support for Jigawa in the implementation of various programmes particularly in the areas of governance reforms, human capital development and economic growth.  He said the new roadmap would help Jigawa to enhance the wellbeing of its people through effective implementation of the comprehensive development framework and other interventions.
