By Coalition of Islamic Organizations on Hijab What You Need To Know About The Religious Discrimination (Prohibition Prevention Ect.) Bill, 2021  WHY THE BILL? Religious discrimination is rampant.

HOW DOES THE BILL ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION? Section 2 of the Bill prohibits discrimination against people on the ground of religion or its manifestation. This is to ensure equality of every person in terms of access to basic amenities, goods and services irrespective of their religious affiliation following the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN as amended) and other International Conventions and Treaties guaranteeing rights of women, and human rights generally.  WHAT IS DISCRIMINATION? Section 4 defines what constitutes direct and indirect discrimination as whatever places a person at a disadvantage if such disadvantage is imposed on such a person merely because of the person’s religious belief(s) or manifestation(s) in direct contravention of the Constitution and other laws the Bill seeks to enforce.  WHO HAS THE BURDEN TO PROVE THE DISCRIMINATION? Section 6 provides that a person that imposes a condition or measure that places a person at a disadvantage, merely based on the person’s religion, has the responsibility and the burden to show that what he or she did, does not constitute direct or indirect discrimination.  WHEN WILL A PERSON BE SAID TO HAVE DISCHARGED THE BURDEN?
