Nigeria-Africa corporate administrators to tackle the challenges
facing leadership and administration. He said that the institute in its quest to fight corruption in the
management system, it has a network of research professional’s fellows

private sectors and business related discipline. He said, ‘’With a common goal of building Nigeria-Africa network of
seasoned corporate administrators and professional secretaries, CASPIN
has upgraded and merged with Nigerian Institute of Professional
Administrators and Office Technology and Management (NIPAS) now taking
