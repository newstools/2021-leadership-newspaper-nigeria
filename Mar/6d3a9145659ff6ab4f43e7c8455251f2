BY DAVID BAMISE Here we are outlining the best small scale business ventures ideas, that someone can start with little capital and yet fetch cool cash both online and offline. With a little training, laptop, software tools, some regular home tools etc a some marketing to let people know what you do. Also develop good relationship with phone dealers for easy referral , quality parts andÂ  accessories.
