Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua wish to sell Odion Ighalo to a European club before the end of the current transfer window, reports Completesports.com. Ighaloâ€™s loan with Premier League club Manchester United will end at the end of the month. And rather than send Ighalo away to another club in a similar deal, Sky Sports says Shanghai Shenhua wish to cash in. For his part, Ighalo is keen on remaining in Europe this year. Agents for the centre-forward have claimed interest from both the Premier League and Serie A.
