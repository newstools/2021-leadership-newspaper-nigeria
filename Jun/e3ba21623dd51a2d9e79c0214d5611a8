The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Ondo State chapter, has disclosed that about 105 doctors have left the state service in the last one year. NMA, which raised the alarm over the mass resignations of its members from the state government’s service, blamed the trend on irregular and percentage payment of salaries by the state government. The Association made the disclosures in a statement jointly signed by the state chairman, Dr. Stella Adegbehingbe and state secretary, Dr. Olorunfemi Owa. The Ondo NMA leadership pointed out that, “Some departments in the State-owned Teaching Hospital, which could hitherto boast of between 6 and 8 Doctors are now left with 1 or 2 Doctors.” According to NMA, this makes it practically impossible for the hospital to function at a minimum acceptable level. “Consequential vacancies in the medical officer cadre need to he urgently tilled. About 50 medical Doctors in this cadre have left the employment of the Hospital Management Board without replacement over the last few months. “Yawning vacancies exist in the Resident Doctor and Consultant cadres at the Teaching Hospital. These have remained difficult to till due to the haphazard safety payments. “We have it on good records that about 105 medical doctors have resigned their employment from the Teaching Hospital in the last year alone. “Ondo State has not been able to engage requisite numbers of House officers since 2019. This has made our work almost impossible because this group of Doctors has a peculiar role in Health service delivery. “It is troubling to note that only three (3) house officers are left in the service of the Ondo State Government across the three senatorial zones. “There is no gainsaying that the ongoing laudable efforts at having a Contributory Health Insurance Scheme
in the state can only be successful it‘ the urgent issue of manpower need is adequately addressed,” NMA added.
