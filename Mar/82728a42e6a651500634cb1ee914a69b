Zinedine Zidane has hinted that Real Madrid will try and re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Juventus this summer. Ronaldo’s future has been the subject of much debate following Juve’s shock round of 16 Champions League exit at the hands of Porto last week. The Italian giants are being tipped to cash in on the 36-year-old before he becomes a free agent in 2022, with Zidane now indicating that a return to Santiago Bernabeu could be on the cards. The Madrid head coach told Sky Italia yesterday ahead of his team’s Champions League clash with Atalanta today: “Rumours are true? Yes, it could be. We know Cristiano, we know what he has done for Real Madrid, but now he is a Juve player, he is playing with another team. We’ll see what his future will be.” The Portuguese superstar permanently etched his name into Madrid history during his nine-year spell at the Bernabeu, helping the club win 15 major trophies including two La Liga crowns and four Champions League titles. He also became their all-time record scorer, hitting a staggering 450 goals in 438 appearances across all competitions, but the team has struggled to achieve the same levels of success since his departure. Madrid’s La Liga triumph last season is the only trophy they have won over the past three years, with Karim Benzema now shouldering the burden of delivering in the final third of the pitch. Eden Hazard was signed from Chelsea to replace Ronaldo in 2019 but his contribution has been significantly restricted by injuries, and the Portuguese striker would surely slot straight back into Zidane’s side if he were to retrace his steps at the end of the current campaign.
