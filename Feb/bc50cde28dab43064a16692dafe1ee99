The 2013 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) winner took to his Instagram yesterday to share a never-seen-before video (Watch Here) from his housewarming ceremony. The event was attended by singer Phyno, Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, and many other dignitaries. Sharing the video, he wrote: “We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.” Recalls that early this year, the Nigerian international recently completed a world-class hospital in his hometown.
