The group managing director/chief executive officer of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, has promised to scale up his bank’s support for the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA). According to him, “in terms of diaspora remittances, we are present in key areas in the continent.”
Speaking while receiving the award as the African Banker of the Year at the 2021 edition of the African Banker Awards, Wigwe said, Access Bank is focused on promoting corporate discipline, stressing that the bank wants to be in key markets on the continent, building a payment gateway and providing trade finance support. The Access Bank MD who is winner in one of the most prized categories at the awards ceremony for the second consecutive year, was recognised for his stellar leadership and market expansion for the bank despite the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The African Banker Awards has become the most respected and recognised industry event celebrating African banking achievements.
Speaking on the award, group publisher of African Banker and chair of the awards committee, Omar Ben Yedder said: “Herbert is one of the most respected bankers on the continent, without a shadow of a doubt. The bank has gone from a lower ranked Nigerian bank when he joined the group as deputy chief executive officer, to become one of Africa’s leading financial services groups. “He has shown a relentless pursuit for growth, but has done so in a measured and calculated manner. What he and his team have done at Access Bank is nothing short of remarkable.”
