By Abu Nmodu  | As scheming for the elective party offices at the forthcoming convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) gather momentum, the North  Central governors have agreed to work towards the zoning the position of the APC national  chairman to the zone. Niger State governor and chairman of the North Central Governors’ Forum, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, gave this indication yesterday when he received in audience members of the North Central APC Stakeholders’ Forum on advocacy visit to him at the Government House, Minna. He declared that “yes we have already discussed to go for the office of national chairman of the APC but it is not in my place to say who would get it or not.” “As the chairman of the North Central Governors’ Forum, I have called a meeting of the governors and we agreed that we should not be left out. There are many aspirants from North West and North East,” he said. According to him, there would be a rotation of positions as “those allocated to the North will move to the South while those in the South will move to North.”. Governor Sani Bello said if the position is allocated to the zone, the governors would meet with stakeholders to decide the best candidate suitable to occupy it.  He argued that in the past few years, the zone had not benefited much in the allocation of national offices even as the zone produced the highest votes in recent elections.  In his speech, the coordinator of the forum, Dominic Alancha, solicited for support for the candidacy of former governor of Nasarawa State Senator Umaru Tanko Almakura for the national chairmanship  of the  party.
