President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday issued a stern warning to terrorists and bandits targeting schools, saying the country would not allow the destruction of the school system. Buhari in a statement issued by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, commended efforts of the Kaduna State government and early response of the military which led to the rescue of 180 students including eight staff members but urged that the others declared missing be found and returned safely to their families. The president also commended efforts and contributions of local intelligence in significantly thwarting the kidnappers, saying a country which has an efficient local intelligence network is a safer country. “Our military may be efficient and well-armed but it needs good efforts for the nation’s defence and the local population must rise to this challenge of the moment.” President Buhari expressed sympathy with the victims of the incident and expressed hope for an early end to the ordeal of those still held captive.
