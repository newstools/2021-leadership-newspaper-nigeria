PIB: Sylva, Kyari To Brief Senators In Closed Session Thursday “Before plenary tomorrow, the leadership of the Senate has decided to invite NNPC GMD to come and brief us in a closed session. “The opportunity is for those of us who are not members of the joint committees who had interactions with NNPC, DPR to at least hear some of the technical details, financial details and implications of certain provisions in the bill,” he said. Lawan also commended members of the committee for doing an extremely good job. “They have devoted themselves, they have sacrificed almost all the recess period just for them to work on the PIB,” he said.
