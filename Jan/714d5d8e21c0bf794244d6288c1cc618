Paula Badosa’s Australian Open spot could be in jeopardy due to her positive Covid-19 test after the Victoria state government confirmed yesterday that anyone contracting the virus would have to undergo an additional period of isolation. Badosa was the first player to have arrived in Australia for the Grand Slam to confirm a positive test, although four were among the 10 cases announced earlier this week. There has been some confusion over the results, however, with several positives later reclassified by Victoria health authorities as “viral shedding” from previous infections. Badosa, the world number 67, flew to Australia from Abu Dhabi and was halfway through her 14-day quarantine period when the 23-year-old’s test came back positive and she was moved to a “health hotel”. While most of the players are able to train for up to five hours a day, more than 70 have been confined to their hotel rooms after some passengers on the three charter flights that brought them to Australia tested positive. At the end of isolation, players will participate in tune-up events from Jan. 31 at Melbourne Park ahead of the Feb. 8-21 hardcourt Grand Slam.
