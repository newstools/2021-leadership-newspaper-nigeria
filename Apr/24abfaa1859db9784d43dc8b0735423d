By Royal Ibeh, Lagos In line with the directive of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), the Lagos State government has concluded the first half of phase one COVID-19 vaccination campaign with over 257,000 residents inoculated. The state’s commissioner for health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, who disclosed this on Wednesday, said, the conclusion of the first phase, which took an average of 20 days, followed the Federal Government’s directive to stop vaccination once half of the consignment has been administered to ensure that those who received the first dose will have an opportunity for the second dose. “This will ensure that at least 1 per cent of Lagos residents receive the full complement of doses required to enable the protection the vaccine promises. The target to achieve effective herd immunity is vaccination of at least 60 per cent of the Lagos State population. The exercise lapsed on Tuesday 13th April 2021. Consequently, the Government has shut down all its vaccination centers,” he said Abayomi said the State inoculated 257,756 persons, as of the 15th of April 2021, consisting of health workers, frontline workers including; security agents, ports of entry staff, Judiciary, petrol station workers, contingency workers and strategic leaders, adding that the government went a step further to vaccinate willing pensioners, people aged 70 and above, teachers and journalists during the same period. Of the 257,756 persons inoculated as of the 15th of April 2021, 59,444 (23.1 per cent) are health workers, 109,809 (42.6 per cent) are essential workers and 88,503 (34.3 per cent) are strategic leaders. Our gender distribution data indicated that we have vaccinated more females than males; with 131,283 females representing 50.9 per cent and 126,473 males representing 49.1 per cent vaccinated as of April 15th, 2021. According to our evaluation report, Eti-Osa, Lagos Mainland, Ikeja, Kosofe, Alimosho and Surulere are the top six Local Government Areas with the highest number of persons vaccinated. 28,257 and 25,094 persons were vaccinated in Eti-Osa and Lagos Mainland. In Ikeja LGA, we vaccinated 23,194 persons; in Kosofe LGA, 19,398 people received the COVID vaccine. For Alimosho and Surulere, 18,954 and 14,963 persons were vaccinated.

The remaining doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID vaccine have been reserved at the Lagos State Cold Chain Store for the second dose exercise, which will commence on the 28th of May, 2021, following the expiration of the 8-12 weeks interval as required by the manufacturers. “Residents are encouraged to check their vaccination cards for their next appointment dates and where possible to try to go to the same health facilities where they got their initial dose for their second dose. There is no need for citizens who have received the first dose to pre-register before going to the health facility for the second dose because their already captured details will only be updated with additional information after vaccination. “The vaccines are due to expire on 9th July 2021. Our monitoring and evaluation quality assurance activity indicates that our cold chain distribution logistics has been maintained ensuring the integrity of the vaccines,” he added.
