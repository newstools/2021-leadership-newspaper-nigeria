Seventeen of the victims were said to have been burnt to death. The ghastly accident, Leadership gathered was caused by over speeding and wrongful overtaking.

It was further gathered that the loss of control by the driver of the Toyota bus while he was trying to overtake a lorry loaded with pepper and a truck that was ahead of him, led to a head-on collision with another truck that was coming at the opposite lane of the road, and thereby caught fire.
