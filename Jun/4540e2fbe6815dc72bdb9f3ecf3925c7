International non-governmental organisations (INGOs) have expressed worry over the plight of over 1million victims of insurgency residing in hard-to-reach areas in Borno State and other states of North East affected by the crisis. Addressing participants yesterday in Maiduguri at a two-day workshop organised for journalists with the theme, “The Role of the Media in Reporting Untold Humanitarian Stories in Northeast”, Camilla Corradin, public adviser INGOs, said in most locations, due to the insecurity, INGOs can only access with humanitarian flights to provide assistance to the affected IDPs and cannot go beyond the areas controlled by government. She said of the 54 INGOs providing humanitarian assistance in North East, 43 are in Borno State, 16 in Yobe State, while 15 are in Adamawa while about 9,000 Staff members are scattered in the states providing humanitarian aids. While noting that about 8.7 million people are in need of urgent assistance, she said over 1.92 million have been uprooted from their homes by the crisis.
The facilitators who took participants on various issues at the workshop include Mojeed Muskili, Editor -in- Chief of Premium Times Newspaper, who educated Journalists on Data Journalism, especially, sourcing relevant humanitarian information. Another facilitator was Ibanga Isine , Managing Editor Next Edition Newspaper, who took participants on conflict sensitive reporting: “A conflict sensitive approach to reporting humanitarian stories in the Northeast.” Participants drawn from the various media organisations in the three most affected states of the Northeast advocated for strong mechanism to regulate the activities of the INGOs operating in the affected states.
