The Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) has shutdown Associated Port & Marine Development Company Limited (APMDC) for charging its customers in foreign exchange for a service rendered in naira. In a statement by the head, public relations of Shippers’ Council, Hajia Rekiya Yagboyaju, said the company has been issued several notices to stop charging in foreign currency but to no avail. Yagboyaju further disclosed that the agency had warned the firm to address infractions ranging from charging in forex to non-compliance with approved nomenclature of charges, such as transport adjustment charges, non-vessel operating carriers, but out rightly disregarded the terms of mediation reached. Speaking after the enforcement exercise, the deputy director, monitoring and enforcement division, Mrs. Celine Ifeora, said NSC sealed APMDC’s premises following its non-compliance with the council’s directive as the port economic regulator. Ifeora assured that APMDC would remain closed until the issues are addressed because the council had invited APMDC for meetings to resolve lingering issues but refused to honour invitations, leaving the council with no other choice but to seal the premises. Also speaking on the issue, Mr. Adesina Sarumi, who led the enforcement team said the enforcement exercise was informed by the need to address anomalies at APMDC.
