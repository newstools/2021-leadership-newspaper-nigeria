Governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have expressed readiness to set in motion the process for the implementation of autonomy of the judiciary and state legislature. This is sequel to the agreement reached by the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) Committee and other stakeholders. The APC governors under the auspices of Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF) said they came to the conclusion after a review of the work done by NGF Committee on autonomy for Judiciary and State Legislature under the Chairmanship of Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. A statement signed by the chairman of the Forum, Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State in Abuja, disclosed that consultations are to commence by the Attorneys-General of APC-controlled states with a view to providing the necessary legal framework for the implementation of the policy. Bagudu noted in his statement that the Tambuwal-led NGF committee consulted all the critical stakeholders, notably leadership of state judiciaries and assemblies. He said the committee jointly reached agreements on specific initiatives to be taken by state governments to guarantee autonomy for state judiciaries and assemblies. He added that the meeting endorsed agreements reached by the Governor Tambuwal-led NGF committee and enjoined all APC controlled states and indeed all states to commence the process of implementing the submitted recommendations. The statement noted that the meeting also received briefings from Governor Mai Mala Buni, the chairman, APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee where the proposed timetable for party congresses leading to the National Convention of the APC was presented.
