A yet-to-be identified man has slapped the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, across the face during a regional tour. Macron’s security entourage pulled the man to the ground and moved the president away immediately while two people were arrested. In a footage obtained by LEADERSHIP from the social media, Macron, dressed in white shirt sleeves, could be seen walking towards a crowd of well-wishers standing behind a metal barrier. He reached out his hand to greet one man, in a green T-shirt, with glasses and a face mask. The man could be heard shouting out “Down with Macronia” (“A Bas La Macronie”) and then he slapped Macron in the face. The man was quickly tackled by the Macron’s security detail and Macron was swiftly ushered away to safety. The presidential administration said there had been an attempt to strike Macron, but declined further comment.
