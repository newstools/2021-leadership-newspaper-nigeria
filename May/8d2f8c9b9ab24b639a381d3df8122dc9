Having transversed the formal, informal setting, working in the corporate world and gathering all necessary exposure, Temilola George and Amina Yakubu decided to work for themselves. Temilola George: Geoscientist & Family Sustainability Expert I saw a lot of resource gap within the environmental sustainability career path even within the oil and gas industry, so I left and took some courses with the hope of starting Plymouth to fill the gap. I started my professional career at Rufil Nigeria Limited, a bore hole drilling company in 2006 and later spent quality time with the following organisations: Bowen and Brown Nigeria Limited (Relationship Manager) in 2008, I joined ENI (Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited-NAOC) in 2009 as Permit and Partners Relations Officer and later as an Exploration Geologist in the Onshore Exploration Projects team. I left ENI in 2017 to establish Plymouth Consult Nigeria Limited (PCN).

My vision as the founder of Plymouth is to deliver quality sustainability & green business awareness, adherence and education in Nigeria and Sub-Sahara Africa. From my early years, I have always been passionate about vulnerable women and children, a factor that drives PCN activities around educating women, youths and children on health and environmental awareness as well as preservation.

I was born forty years ago in Akure, Ondo State South Western Nigeria. An indigene of Ekiti State, Ise Ekiti to be precise. I started my early education at Alagbaka Nursery & Primary School but the family move to Ado Ekiti because my father was transferred and I completed my Elementary education at the Federal Polytechnic Staff School Ado Ekiti. I attended Unity Secondary school between 1991-1997, and later Federal Polytechnic Ado Ekiti to study Mineral Resources Engineering, from where I got Direct Entry Admission into Adekunle Ajasin University and graduated in 2005 with a degree in Geology Science. I had my mandatory one year youth service (NYSC) in Kogi State, at the National Iron Mining Company Itakpe, as an Exploration Geologist.
