No wonder you are held very high across the country and constantly described as a unifying force for the nation’s continued growth and progress.’’ The Speaker described Tinubu as a ‘political mathematician’ whose ability to solve equations with deftness and sagacity has resulted in major successes including the presidential elections of 2015 and 2019 recorded by Nigeria.
