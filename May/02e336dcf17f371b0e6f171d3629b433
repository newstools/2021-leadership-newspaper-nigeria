SHE SAYS… Adamazi Mbonu Jennifer: ‘Having zero expectations helps keep one sane’ THE NIGERIAN BLOGGER TAKES US THROUGH THE FIVE HARD LESSONS LIFE HAS TAUGHT HER AND HOW TO SURVIVE IN THOSE MOMENTS. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-293038" src="https://i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Adamaz.jpg?resize=598%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="598" height="600" srcset="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Adamaz.jpg?resize=598%2C600&amp;ssl=1 598w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Adamaz.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Adamaz.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Adamaz.jpg?resize=75%2C75&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Interview by Henry Tyohemba Have zero expectations: As I journey through life, I’ve come to realize that having zero expectations help to keep me sane. I do not expect anything from anyone and so, there’s no reason to be annoyed that anyone disappointed me. Trust no one: I put my trust wholly in God. Humans have broken promises made to me so many times and I’ve come to realize that only God can say a thing and bring it to pass. No one else can hold on to their words like God does to us.  Love with your head: Having a strong emotional attachment to anyone could be suicidal. I learnt to love with my head rather than my heart. This helps me to keep moving and not wallow in self pity should there be any break in relationship.  Be Patient: Nothing beautiful has been gotten through desperation. Life has taught me over the years to be patient and wait for what I truly deserve. Indeed, good things come to those who wait.  Have no regrets: No regrets in life, only lessons learned no matter how the situation turns out. No regrets. I learn my lessons and move on.

Everyone almost certainly has a favorite meal of the day, to some it could be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Given that dinner is the last meal of the day, it is one of the reasons why I love it. The feeling of knowing that every day when I work and become so tiring, I will go home and munch down on food before going to bed is the best to me. Dinner is the meal that I get to do without. I don’t think there is any better meal that one can eat the most after a long day rather dinner. I have always loved going out to dinner with my family, it felt like a special treat, a time to get a big meal and spend time together. I also loved having dinner at home, cooking for my family and spending time at the table talking about the family affairs, it really feels good.  MY FRIDAY LOOK Abdullahi Yahaya What are your perfect casual Friday outfits?  My Friday outfits are always simple and unique because Friday is one the best days. God said we should look neat to Juma’at prayer and also have the opportunity of visiting our friends and relatives. Any touch to your natural look? I want to be original therefore I don’t touch anything except my hair, finger nails, both hands and legs, aside this nothing more again. What is one of the first considerations on your look when going out? I always considered my look to make sure I appear decent, been decent is my priority.
