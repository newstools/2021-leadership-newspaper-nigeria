Lagos State House of Assembly has adopted the report of the Committee on Information and Strategy over the retrenchment of 155 contract staff of Lagos State Neighborhood Safety Corps (LNSC) who served three-term of 25 years without payment of any benefit. The retrenched contract staff who were absorbed from the defunct Lagos State Neighborhood Watch served as volunteers before they were co-opted into Lagos State Neighborhood Safety Corps as contract staff when it was established in 1919. The report was read on the floor of the House by chairman, House Committee on Information and Strategy, David Setonji, in view of a petition that requested for intervention of the house on the matter. The lawmaker recommended that 11 retrenched contract staff that are above 65 years of age be reabsorbed for another two year-term and be compensated after expiration of their tenure while those below 55 years should be absorbed for another contract period. He stated that after the expiration of the tenure of the contract staff below 55 years they should be paid off accordingly having assisted in securing the state over a period of time. Meantime, the suspension of two local government chairmen Ogidan Mukandasi Olaitan of Lekki Local Council Development Area (LCDA), and Suleiman Jelili of Alimosho Local Council Development Area was lifted by the House during its sitting on Monday while that of Tajudeen Ajide of Surulere Local Government had earlier been lifted.
