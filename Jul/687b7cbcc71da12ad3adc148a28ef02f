The Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (YOSEMA) has assisted the victims of windstorm and flood disaster in Jajimaji, the headquarters of Karasuwa local government area of Yobe State. The executive secretary of the Agency Dr Mohammed Goje said the support was meant to cushion the effects of a heavy windstorm and flood disaster that affected over 191 households last week. Goje said the assistant which was a directive by Governor Mai Mala Buni, was meant to ameliorate the sufferings of the victims of the disaster which destroyed several public and private roofs, market stalls among other public properties. He said, “His Excellency the executive governor of Yobe State Hon. Mai Mala Buni has directed that while the government is working tirelessly to provide more support to other vulnerable populace, it is pertinent to assist those affected by the disaster with food among others. “The support, especially to those who take refuge in their neighbourhood is necessary so as not to overstretch the host household of their resources,” the ES maintained. According to him, most victims of the disaster are predominantly petty traders and low-income earners who live by the day’s earnings. “Each beneficiary will go home with food items such as (rice and combo pack containing pastas and condiments) WASH Kits including buckets, plates, soap, detergent, torch light, jerrycan, kettle as well as mosquito nets, mats, mattresses among other items.” Goje said the distribution is being carried out between the officials of SEMA and that of the Karasuwa local government area.
