In bold move to step up the fight against doping by athletes,  the Federal Ministry  of Youth and sports Development is to partner with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural  Organisation, (UNESCO). Speaking during a courtesy call to the Minister of youth and sports  development, Sunday Dare, the Nigerian Ambassador to UNESCO, Hajiya Hajo Sani commended the Minister for his  innovations and sustained efforts. “we want to commend the Ministry for all the youth and sports focused initiatives that’s has been running and yielding results.  On our part we will continue to ensure that our sportsmen and women compete clean in all competitions in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and beyond by not  taking any substances that violate rules of Sports”. In his response, the minister said “This meeting is coming at an opportuned time when we are  just few days to the commencement  of the Tokyo Olympics. I believe your job as Nigerian Ambassador to UNESCO is a  choice that is justifiable. “In a deliberate way we seek partnerships and collaborations in any organisation that is Youth focused.As a  Ministry we will keep availing the youth of our country the benefits that are available. We are barely 8 days to the commencement of Tokyo 2020 Olympics and emphasis has been on the need to have clean sports as we’ve been charging the Athletes to compete fairly and clean without using any banned substances. “In another few days we will see over 58 of our athletes in 9 different sports competing with the best from the world in Tokyo. Through the years of preparations, the emphasis has been on making sure we do not violate any of the guidelines provided by the World Anti-Dopping Agency.”
