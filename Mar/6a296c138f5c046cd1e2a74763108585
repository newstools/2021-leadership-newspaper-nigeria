He was given the jab at exactly 10:28am after e-registration and filling out of their vaccination card and sat for 15 minutes according to the routine of vaccination. He was later presented with vaccination card by the chief medical director of the State House Medical Centre, Dr. Husain Munir.

In his remarks, Gambari said the vaccination was painless and that he followed the footsteps of President Buhari who demonstrated leadership alongside his deputy receiving the jabs on Saturday.  He advised eligible Nigerians to take the vaccines assuring that it is safe. He added that the more Nigerians are vaccinated the more we are safe.   NDLEA boss, Marwa said the vaccine is painless and he feels good.
