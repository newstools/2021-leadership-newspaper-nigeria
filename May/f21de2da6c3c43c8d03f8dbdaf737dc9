Premier League ’s ‘Big Six’ and six other top clubs could be at risk from a two-year ban from European competitions as UEFA consider punishments for the clubs who formed the European Super League. Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City were part of the 12 teams who attempted a breakaway from UEFA just over a fortnight ago. UEFA Announces New Format For Champions League, Europa  They immediately faced a huge backlash from fans, pundits and even players, with all six English clubs stating they would be pulling out within 48 hours of the original announcement. Though they have announced their intention to withdraw, officially that has not yet happened, with competition chairman Florentino Perez continuing to state that the competition will go ahead. But many are now pushing for UEFA and the Premier League to deal out heavy punishments to the clubs who were involved in an effort to deter any future attempts to break away. And according to ESPN, one of the punishments UEFA is considering is a two-year Champions League and Europa League ban. It would be the strongest sanction available to UEFA with the clubs, who are all usual fixtures in the competitions, barred from taking part. While this sanction is believed to be used to pressure Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and AC Milan to also pull out of the Super League, it could still be used on the clubs who do not officially withdraw. The four aforementioned clubs continue to remain in the breakaway competition, seeing their position as strong enough to escape any punishment. But UEFA are aiming to see as many clubs as possible withdraw and can point to Article 51 of their statutes in order to back up any punishment.
The article states: “No combinations or alliances between… clubs affiliated, directly or indirectly, to different UEFA Member Associations may be formed without the permission of UEFA.”
