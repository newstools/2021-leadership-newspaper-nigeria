According to the musician who has strived to remain relevant in the music industry, the visual of the single will feature Mr Raw Nwanne and Madarocker, and will hit the screens soon. “Jaga Jaga Reloaded” is the Kano-born documenting the ills of the country. Of the reggae genre, the song condemned police brutality and speaks about the #EndSARS protest and the alleged shooting that followed the alleged killing of innocent protesters.
