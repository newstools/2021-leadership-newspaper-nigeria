The Nigerian equities market performance this week market will be dictated by the performance of the first half (H1) of 2021 earnings results. Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited said: “with the first half (H1) of 2021 earnings season on the horizon, we believe investors will be looking for clues on the sustainability of the decent corporate earnings released for Q1, 2021. “However, we expect mixed market performance in the week ahead as bargain hunting in dividend-paying stocks will be matched by intermittent profit-taking activities. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Afrinvest Limited said: “in the coming week, we expect to see slight profit-taking at the start of the week. However, we envisage market performance will be dictated by the performance of the H1:2021 earnings results.” Also, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited expected the equities market to trade northward as investors position ahead in stocks of fundamentally sound companies which are also expected to pay interim dividends. The chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr. Ambrose Omordion said: “we expect sustained trend being the beginning of earnings season month after forming a chart pattern that support an uptrend as bargain hunters take advantage of pullbacks to reposition ahead of half year earnings reporting season. It is noteworthy that oil price continues its recovery at the international market with full-year and interim dividend possibilities around the corner.”  He also noted that, some stocks are trading within their buy ranges to become more attractive at this point for income investors and traders, even as the market anticipates positive news, while oil price continues to oscillate above $73 per barrel to support global economic and stock market recovery across climates, saying,  “we also expect the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination to support global and domestic economic recovery that will enhance the market and give direction.” According to Omordion, “the banking sector and others remain attractive on the back of the prevailing low prices, despite the Q1 mixed numbers. Again, the way to go is to target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities ahead of interim dividend announcement. This is especially given that despite the seeming improvements, fixed income yield continues to offer negative real rate of return due to the galloping inflation. “However, the strong and faster recovery may continue, depending on market forces, going forward, as propelled by expected Q2 earnings reports, until the next MPC meeting in July.” Meanwhile, last week, sentiment turned positive in the market as investors hunted for bargains on dividend paying and stocks with good fundamentals as the half year earnings season approaches.
