BY TOPE FAYEHUN  | Convinced that incessant cases of kidnapping and other criminal activities are perpetrated by herders in the state’s forest reserves, Ondo State House of Assembly, monarchs, farmers, forest guards and drivers in the state have thrown their weight behind the order given by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu  to unregistered herders to vacate government forest reserves. To show their solidarity, they took to the streets of Akure, the state capital on Thursday, to demonstrate their anger over the incessant abduction of their members by the herders. Armed with placards with various inscriptions, the protesters frowned at the statement credited to the presidency that Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu shouldn’t have given such order. According to them, the decision taken by the state government was done in the best interest of the people in the State. Some farmers said if the current state of insecurity is not quickly checked, it might lead to famine in the state The State House of Assembly said the seven days ultimatum issued to herdsmen to quit the state forests was a good intention meant to secure the lives and property of the people.
