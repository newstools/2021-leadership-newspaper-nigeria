quick passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law”. “I want to commend the efforts of the IFA and that of our other partners at deepening the participation of the PWDs in the electoral process through the mainstreaming of their issues in our operations. The public presentation of the data for inclusion report today bears eloquent testimony to this commitment to make election process more accessible to the PWDs”, he said.
