OBSESSIONS SEUN FAVOUR LIGHTNING ROUND-UP        HE SAYS… Muhammed Hamza: ‘Humanty Can Make One Great’ HE IDENTIFIED TIPS ON HOW YOUTHS CAN SURVIVE IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT.  Be humble! Humility allows you to be open to learning from elders and making adjustments to become a better person. In the current environment, it is popular to be arrogant but such attitudes can only prevent an individual from developing healthy relationships with others and achieve great things.  Set values. If you place a high value on your life it will affect the choices you make. For instance, if you value your life, you will think twice about doing anything that may affect your life in future. Moreover, if you value your freedom, you will avoid crimes and behavior that can lead to incarceration and all other vices that put one into condemnation.  Always think before you act.  Most people make decisions without considering a second thought. The simple but effective process of thought will help you avoid making critical mistakes that could cost you your freedom, education or your life. Do not be a follower. Avoid following popular trends that could lead to a high-risk lifestyle, such as becoming so obsessed with materialism that you will do illegal activities to obtain certain things. Also, avoid being part of the crowd. Without being a loner, you can separate yourself from the group of people who are not engaged in positive things and still have a social life.
