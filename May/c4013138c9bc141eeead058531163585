By Olawale Ayeni, Abuja Conference of Nigerian Sports Federations (CNSF) has given the minister of youth and sport development, Mr Sunday Dare, 48-hours ultimatum to reverse the dissolution of the boards of all 31 sporting federations. Addressing newsmen in Abuja yesterday, representative of CNSF, Frederick Abah, condemned and rejected the establishment of caretaker committees while calling on the minister not to jeopardise the future of Nigeria’s sportsmen and women. “The board members of the 31 Sports Federations hereby give the Minister a 48-hour ultimatum within which he is to rescind and reverse all unlawful pronouncements he made over the dissolution of duly elected board members of Sports Federations or face appropriate actions from the Federations. “We totally rejected the arbitrary and untimely dissolution of the boards of duly and democratically elected Federations and also condemned and rejected the establishment of caretaker committees over duly and democratically elected sports Federations whose tenures were yet to expire.” “The members unequivocally stated that on no account will the caretaker committees be recognised by the International Bodies of the various Sports Federations in place of the duly elected boards,” Abah said. Meanwhile, Stakeholder Ahmed Gara Gombe alleged that the lust for power and greed to siphon Olympic funds is responsible for the dissolution carried out by the minister. He said the federations will go on protest and take legal actions if the 48-hour ultimatum is not met by the minister. “Board elections were held on June 13, 2017 and the inauguration into office was done on July 10, 2017 for a 4-year tenure.  The tenure will therefore expire on July 10, 2021 and not April 30, 2021 when the Federations were dissolved,” Gara noted.
