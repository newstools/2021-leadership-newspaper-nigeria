The decline follows the investors’ profit-taking on some recently appreciated stocks, such as Stanbic IBTC Holdings and 19 others.

The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Okomu Oil, Guinness Nigeria, Nigerian Breweries and Custodian Investment.
